<p>You've just generated a small application — we hope it was quick, exciting, and impressive! Great job! Here are a few key takeaways from our perspective:</p>

<ol>
<li>Modern code generation tools are excellent at creating small utility modules.</li>
<li>Frontend development can be significantly accelerated – AI makes prototyping feel fun and game-like.</li>
<li>You can not only generate programs from scratch but also improve them incrementally.</li>
</ol>

<p>See you in other more complex (but equally impressive) projects. Bye for now!</p>
