<p>You are ready to generate the application.</p>
<p>First, let's check:</p>
<ol interactive>
<li title="You have enabled <code>auto-run</code> mode"></li>
<li title="Your Chat is in <code>agent</code> mode"></li>
</ol>

<p>If yes, it is enough to run this prompt:</p>

<callout type="chat">
Generate a browser app that accesses my camera and gives me the ability to select Instagram-like filters to my video stream on the fly. Use HTML, CSS and JS only. Don't use any UI library.
</callout>

<alert>You should press the "Accept All" button after the generation is finished to apply all changes.</alert>

<p><checkable-item title="Once the application is generated, run it by opening the <code>index.html</code> file in your browser."></checkable-item></p>

<alert>
<details>
<summary>What if it doesn't work?</summary>
<div>
<p>If the application doesn't build for a very long time, or it builds but doesn't work as expected, try deleting all project files and start generating again.</p>
<p>AI is still not perfect. And a successful result is already very likely, but not mandatory. After several attempts you always get what you need.</p>
<p>Also, there is a known issue when the Cursor app has exhausted its attempts to generate your app and it asks to continue manually. You will see this message: <code>"Note: By default, we stop the agent after 25 tool calls. Please ask the agent to resume manually"</code>.</p>
<p>In this case, please open a new Chat and continue fixing the app.</p>
