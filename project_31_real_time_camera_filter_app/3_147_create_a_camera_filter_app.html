<p>You are ready to generate the application.</p>
<p>First, let's check:</p>
<ol interactive>
<li title="You have enabled YOLO mode"></li>
<li title="Your Chat is in 'agent' mode"></li>
</ol>

<p>If yes, it is enough to run this prompt:</p>

<callout type="chat">
Generate a browser app that accesses my camera and gives me the ability to select Instagram-like filters to my video stream on the fly. Use HTML, CSS and JS only. Don't use any UI library.
</callout>

<warning>You should press the "Accept All" button after the generation is finished to apply all changes.</warning>

<p>If the Chat assistant has terminated but the application has not started (you have not seen any messages in the terminal that the application is running at <code>http://localhost:8000</code>), simply enter an additional command in Chat.</p>

<callout type="chat">
Run this application. If an error occurred, try to fix it and then run the application again.
</callout>

<details>
<summary>What if it doesnâ€™t work?</summary>
<div>
<p>If the application doesn't build for a very long time, or it builds but doesn't work as expected, try deleting all project files and start generating again.</p>
<p>AI is still not perfect. And a successful result is already very likely, but not mandatory. After several attempts you always get what you need.</p>
<p>We have also noticed that sometimes the application is created but not launched. In this case, you just have to ask Chat: <code>run my application and fix the errors that occurred at startup</code>.</p>
<p>Also, there is a known issue when the Cursor app has exhausted its attempts to generate your app and it asks to continue manually. You will see this message: <code>"Note: By default, we stop the agent after 25 tool calls. Please ask the agent to resume manually"</code>.</p>
<p>In this case, please open a new Chat and continue fixing the app.</p>
