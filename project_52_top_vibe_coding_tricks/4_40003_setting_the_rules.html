<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>We've adopted the "AI Manager Mindset" and created a project plan. Now, before our intern starts working, we need to give them their "Employee Handbook." This handbook contains the ground rules: a clear set of instructions on how to behave, what to do, and what <em>not</em> to do while working on our project.</p>
<p>Setting rules upfront is a critical management step. It saves countless hours of future frustration by preemptively correcting the AI's common mistakes and aligning its behavior with your specific preferences from the very beginning.</p>
<h5>The Challenge: The Eager Yet Unsupervised Intern</h5>
<p>An intern without rules will make their own assumptions, often leading to chaos. When your AI doesn't have clear guidelines, it will exhibit frustrating behaviors based on its default behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The "Creative" Coder:</strong> You ask the AI to change the color of a button, and it decides to "helpfully" refactor the entire file, introducing subtle bugs in the process. It doesn't know the boundaries of the task.</li>
<li><strong>The Know-It-All:</strong> The AI defaults to using older versions of libraries it was trained on most extensively (e.g., Tailwind CSS v3), even if you need to use a newer version (v4). It uses what it's most confident in, not what the project requires.</li>
<li><strong>The Inefficient Worker:</strong> It writes a brand-new function to sort a list, even though a perfectly good sorting function already exists elsewhere in your project. It doesn't know it's supposed to look for existing solutions first.</li>
<li><strong>The Inconsistent Stylist:</strong> It writes code using tabs in one file and spaces in another, or mixes different naming conventions (like <code>camelCase</code> and <code>snake_case</code>), creating a messy and hard-to-read codebase.</li>
</ul>
<p>These aren't malicious actions; they are the result of an unmanaged intern making assumptions. It's our job as the manager to replace those assumptions with clear rules.</p>
<h5>The Trick: Creating the "Employee Handbook"</h5>
<p>The solution is to establish a set of project-specific rules that your AI must follow. In modern AI IDEs, this is often done by creating a special file (like <code>rules.md</code> or <code>.cursorrules</code>) or by adding instructions to a "custom instructions" panel in the settings. These rules act as a permanent system prompt, automatically giving your intern its instructions with every request.</p>
<p>Here are some of the useful rules you can set:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule #1: Plan First, Code Second.</strong> "Explain your plan step-by-step first. Ask for my confirmation before you write any code."</li>
<li><strong>Rule #2: Simplicity and Focus.</strong> "Do the simplest thing first. Only make the changes I have specifically requested."</li>
<li><strong>Rule #3: Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY).</strong> "Before writing new code, always check the existing codebase for a solution you can reuse."</li>
<li><strong>Rule #4: Respect the Tech Stack.</strong> "This project uses [Your Library/Framework, e.g., 'React 18']. Do not use features from other frameworks or older versions."</li>
</ul>
<h5>Creating Your Rules</h5>
<p>In your IDE, create a file named <code>rules.md</code> (or use the equivalent feature) and write a clear set of instructions for your AI.</p>
<callout label="Create a 'rules.md' file with the following rules">
# Project Rules 
Plan First: Before you write or change any code, explain your plan in simple terms. Wait for my "sounds good" or "proceed" confirmation before you start.
Keep It Simple: Only implement the specific feature I ask for. Do not add extra functionality or refactor code unless I request it.
One File at a Time: When possible, limit your changes to a single file per request.
Check for Duplicates: Before writing a new function, check if a similar one already exists in the project.
Add Comments: Add simple, one-line comments to explain any complex parts of the JavaScript code you write.
</callout>
<p>By creating this simple file, you ensure the AI follows these rules before generating any code, which will significantly reduce the number of times you need to correct its work.</p>

<h5>Outcome of This Trick and Next Steps</h5>
<p>You have now put a crucial system in place for managing your AI. By setting clear ground rules, you have made your intern a more predictable, reliable, and effective teammate, saving yourself from future confusion and rework.</p>
