<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>Model Context Protocol (MCP) quickly gained popularity, and for a good reason. They supercharge LLMs with new abilities, helping to overcome their limitations and making the lives of vibe coders easier.</p>
<p>There are many useful MCPs available, and depending on your project, you might need to find a specific one for your needs. Let's explore one common problem and how an MCP can solve it.</p>

<h5>The Challenge: Knowledge Cutoff</h5>
<p>A significant limitation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their knowledge cutoff. An AI's training data has a fixed date, meaning it is unaware of any new libraries, API changes, or framework updates that were released after that time.</p>
<p>This leads to several problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outdated Code:</strong> The AI may generate code using deprecated functions or old patterns that are no longer best practice.</li>
<li><strong>Hallucinations:</strong> When asked about a recent technology it doesn't know, the AI might "hallucinate" and invent plausible-sounding but incorrect code, leading to frustrating bugs.</li>
<li><strong>Wasted Time:</strong> You end up spending valuable time correcting the AI's mistakes, manually looking up documentation, and teaching it the correct way to use a new tool.</li>
</ul>

<h5>The Trick: Use Context7 MCP for Up-to-Date Documentation</h5>
<p>The solution is to give your AI assistant access to the latest information using the <a href="https://github.com/upstash/context7">Context7 MCP</a> . This tool connects your AI to a server that provides up-to-date documentation for thousands of libraries and frameworks.</p>
<p>By adding the Context7 MCP, you give your AI intern the latest API documentation, which drastically increases accuracy, improves code quality, and prevents hallucinations.</p>

<h5>Outcome of This Lesson and Next Steps</h5>
<p>You now know how to overcome the AI's knowledge cutoff by equipping it with the Context7 MCP. This ensures your AI assistant always has access to the most current documentation, allowing it to write better, more accurate code.</p>
<p>In the next lesson, we will focus on another powerful trick for improving your vibe coding workflow.</p>
