<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>You all probably heard about the "MCP" (Model Context Protocol) many times by now. And for a good reason, because they allow to give your AI intern a new tools or knowledge to overcome its limitations.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>The Challenge: The AI Limiatations and default skillset</h5>
<p>By default, your AI intern works in a vacuum. It only knows what was in its training data and what's in your current conversation. This creates several major problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Outdated Knowledge:</strong> The AI's training data has a "knowledge cutoff" date. It doesn't know about new library versions or API changes, leading it to write deprecated or broken code.</li>
<li><strong>No Project-Wide Awareness:</strong> The AI can't see your entire private GitHub repository. It only knows about the few files you've explicitly shown it, so it can't understand how all the parts of your project fit together.</li>
<li><strong>Inability to "See" Designs:</strong> You can't ask the AI to build a component from a Figma design, because it has no eyes. You're forced to describe the design in words, which is slow and inaccurate.</li>
</ul>

<p>When faced with these gaps, the AI is forced to guess or "hallucinate," inventing solutions that are plausible but wrong.</p>

<h5>The Solution: Equip Your Intern with MCPs</h5>

<p>MCP is a protocol that allows to connect the AI to a special server that provides it with new tools or knowledge designed to work with LLMs.</p>

<p>There are three main types of MCPs you will use:</p>

<p>Using the right MCP ensures your intern is fully equipped and prepared for the task at hand.</p>

<h5>Outcome of This Lesson and Next Steps</h5>
<p>You now know how to equip your AI intern with superpowers. By providing direct access to documentation, designs, and your full codebase using MCPs, you enable it to perform a much wider variety of tasks with greater accuracy.</p>
<p>You are now a fully-equipped AI manager. In the next lessons, we will focus on <strong>Debugging and Iteration</strong>, learning what to do when things get difficult.</p>
