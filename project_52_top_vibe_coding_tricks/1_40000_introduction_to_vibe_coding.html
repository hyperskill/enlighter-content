<h5>Welcome to the Vibe Coding Tricks Course</h5>

<img style="margin: auto; display: block;" width="450px" src="https://ucarecdn.com/0a12802e-8392-43ff-9c0d-f3d832a0831d/" alt="Vibe Coding Tricks" title="Vibe Coding Tricks">
<p>
    Vibe Coding is a powerful new way to develop apps and products quickly. By working hand in hand with AI, 
    you can turn ideas into real prototypes or MVPs in record time. It opens the door for non‑technical people 
    to create and test their concepts without needing to write every line of code themselves or learn frameworks and SDKs. 
</p>

<p>
    But as exciting as Vibe Coding is, anyone who has tried to build larger or more complex projects knows the 
    reality: AI isn’t magic. It can misunderstand your intentions, produce inconsistent results, or fail to meet 
    your exact vision. These challenges can easily slow you down and kill your creative flow.
</p>

<p>
    That’s why we collected the most practical tips, tricks, and workflows that consistently 
    give the best results when coding with AI. These are not just random tips—they come from real-world experience 
    and feedback from developers who use Vibe Coding daily. Some might seem obvious, but each one solves a specific 
    problem and can dramatically improve your outcomes when applied correctly.
