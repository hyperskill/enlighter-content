<h5>Deployment and DevOps</h5>

<p>After testing confirms that the software meets quality standards, the next phase in the SDLC is Deployment. This phase involves releasing the software to production environments where users can access it. Modern deployment is closely tied to DevOps practices, which aim to unify software development and operations.</p>

<p>In this section, we'll explore how Junie can assist with deployment and DevOps activities, helping teams deliver software more efficiently and reliably.</p>

<h5>Key Deployment and DevOps Activities</h5>

<p>The deployment phase encompasses several important activities:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Environment Configuration</strong>: Setting up and configuring production environments.</li>
    <li><strong>Deployment Automation</strong>: Creating scripts and pipelines for automated deployment.</li>
    <li><strong>Infrastructure as Code</strong>: Managing infrastructure through code and configuration files.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</strong>: Automating build, test, and deployment processes.</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring and Alerting</strong>: Setting up systems to track application health and performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Rollback Planning</strong>: Preparing strategies for reverting to previous versions if issues arise.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Common Challenges in Deployment</h5>

<p>Teams often face these challenges during deployment:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Environment Consistency</strong>: Ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.</li>
    <li><strong>Configuration Management</strong>: Managing different configurations for different environments.</li>
    <li><strong>Deployment Failures</strong>: Handling failed deployments and minimizing downtime.</li>
    <li><strong>Security Concerns</strong>: Implementing proper security measures in production.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Ensuring the application can handle production load.</li>
    <li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Maintaining up-to-date deployment documentation.</li>
</ul>

<callout label="Ask Junie to create a CI/CD pipeline">
Create a GitHub Actions workflow for a Node.js application that:
1. Runs on push to main branch and pull requests
2. Sets up Node.js environment
3. Installs dependencies
4. Runs linting
5. Runs unit tests
6. Builds the application
7. Deploys to AWS Elastic Beanstalk when merged to main
8. Sends notifications on success/failure

2. Handles environment-specific settings (dev, staging, production)
3. Securely manages sensitive information like API keys and database credentials
4. Allows for runtime configuration changes without redeployment
5. Works well in a containerized environment
</callout>

<h5>5. Monitoring and Alerting Setup</h5>
