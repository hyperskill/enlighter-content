<p>That was awesome! Here are a few conclusions that we feel are important to emphasize as a result of this app.</p>

<ol>
<li>Cursor's AI tools can help build applications as well as understand technical terms and issues.</li>
<li>For application generation, it is very important to correctly describe the context that the AI will use when generating code.</li>
<li>It is best if the context includes the characteristics of your system, all keys, accesses, and descriptions of the recommended LLM models for generating the application.</li>
<li>Cursor does a better job of generating applications when the context is loaded with the documentation needed for the future application to work correctly.</li>
<li>If you want to not only generate applications, but also learn technologies through Cursor, it is useful to set the Tone of Voice context so that the responses from the LLM are written in a language you can understand.</li>
<li>The most important part of creating an application with the LLM is the prompt that describes the functionality you need and the requirements for the application. Some technical background is required to write these prompts. Sometimes the prompt has to be improved step by step by observing what difficulties the AI encounters during generation and debugging.</li>
<li>Describing good prompts requires some technical expertise, but you can build it by looking at examples of other prompts like ours. Just ask in the chat room for obscure terms.</li>
<li>Cursor can be configured to build, test, and debug the application without your involvement. It all depends on how much you want to control the process.</li>
<li>An already generated application can be improved incrementally with additional requirements. You can also generate the application incrementally, module by module. In this lesson, we suggested that you add or remove the test system, as well as some ideas for improving the application.</li>
<li>The process of creating applications with Cursor is still software engineering, but with the available LLM superpower as an assistant.</li>
