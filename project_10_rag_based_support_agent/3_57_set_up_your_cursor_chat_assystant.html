  Before we start working on the app, please set up your cursor chat assystant.

  So first, we recommend that you turn on YOLO mode in the cursor settings. You
  can find this option in Preferences, then Cursor Settings, then Features.

  These requirements will help LLM to perform autogeneration and auto-fixing of
  your application with minimal user intervention. Sometimes you will be asked
  to run shell commands, but in most cases the cursor will do everything by
  itself. Chat will also see any errors that occur and try to fix them on the
  fly.
</p>
<warning
  >If you are unable to activate agent mode in an empty project, that's okay.
  Just make sure that agent mode is enabled before generating your application.
  Cursor tries to detect the type of your request automatically and does not
  always activate the right switch.</warning
