<p>You'll create a system that downloads tickets from the tracker that have already been answered by your technical support team â€“ along with their responses. Based on these, the system will recommend replies to new tickets. This works because the model is trained on typical answers from the past, helping resolve new user questions more quickly.</p>

<p>In this project, we'll focus on using AI coding tools to solve real product use cases. We'll guide you through building a final project based on a description. Along the way, you'll explore key features of the IDE that will help you create the right context and prompts.</p>

<p>Let's start by chatting with Agent. Run the following command and explore how the final app can be used.</p>

<p>Go ahead and start preparing to build this app!</p> 


<p>To access the ticketing system we have prepared for you, <b>just follow <a href="https://aidl-001-zd-mock.replit.app/register" target="_blank">the link</a> and register.</b></p>

<ul interactive><li title="Follow the link and register on the website"></li></ul>

<p>You'll see a set of tickets prepared for you, some of them are marked as solved and some of them have the status "open." Both of them will be needed for further development and testing of your application.</p>

<p>Also, don't forget to check out the "New ticket" link. You can find the authorization key there:</p>

<ul interactive><li title='Check your API key on the "New ticket" link'></li></ul>

<p>You'll be using this info to connect to the tickets database from your app. If you need a refresher on how your app will communicate with the database, no worries! The documentation on <a href="https://aidl-001-zd-mock.replit.app/api-docs/" target="_blank">this link</a> has you covered. This is a common way of describing API (Application Programming Interface). Most programmers are familiar with this term. Feel free to chat with the AI assistant about it and explore what it is as well.</p>

<ul interactive><li title="Ask the chat what the API term mean"></li></ul>

What is API in simple words? What does endpint term describe? Give me an analogy as I was 10 years old.
