<p>You can find a description of how the API works at this link. Now, we need to add this to our Cursor APP as context. We can simply copy and paste all the useful info to the context file. To make it easier, we've prepared a JSON-representation of the API docs page. This is the same content, but in a single text file. You can use it to build context for any Zendesk-based app. The documentation is the same as the official one.</p>

<p>Backend applications can be programmed in different languages. The main thing is to configure your computer so that it understands this language. We will program the whole system in Python.
