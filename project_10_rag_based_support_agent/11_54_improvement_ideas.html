<p>Good job! Your app should work now. Congrats!</p> Here's some advice to improve it and practice AI coding skills.

<p>We use a hardcoded user ID in our prompt. We know that our support agent has <code>ID 111</code>, but this isn't a scalable solution. Try improving your app to get all supporter IDs from the API and implement updates to the code base. It could be quite challenging, but don't give up. Exploring AI tools may seem challenging, but it's an important skill for the future of product development.</p>

<p>☑️ Try to improve your app on your own. Replace the hardcoded ID with the new one your app can get from the API.</p>
