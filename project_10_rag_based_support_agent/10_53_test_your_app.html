<p>Let's make the app better by adding a feature that lets you type in a random question and get an answer based on RAG right from the console. Try running this command in the chat to see what happens.</p>

<callout type="chat">
I want to test my application. Please give me the ability to enter my own question from the console and receive an answer.
</callout>

<p>Cursor can make your code better by getting information from the terminal and responding using RAG.</p>

<p>Ask your RAG how to reset your password, and they should show you correct instructions.</p>

<alert>We've added some kind of testing requests to our initial requirements prompt. Cursor can interpret it literally and run your app with user input from the first generation. If so, just skip this step. Or try to ask Chat to remove this testing functionality, keeping other functions. It will be a good exercise.</alert>
