<p>Time to see our rule in action! We'll make sure it works by creating a simple test function. But first, let's add a fun twist to our rule that will make its effects clearly visible.</p>

<h5>Adding a Visible Effect</h5>

<p>Let's modify our rule to add a print statement to every function. This will help us see when our rule is being applied:</p>

<callout type="chat">
    Add to @coding-standards.mdc:
    Insert print("Hello, beautiful learner") at the start of every Python function
</callout>

<ul interactive>
    <li title="Verify rule modification">
        Check that the rule now includes the print statement requirement<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<h5>Creating a Test Function</h5>

<p>Now we'll create a simple function to demonstrate our rule in action:</p>

<callout type="chat">
    Create src/test_function.py with a function that prints its own name when called
</callout>

<h5>Running the Test</h5>

<p>Let's run our code and see what happens:</p>

<callout type="chat">
    Run test_function.py in the terminal
</callout>

<h5>Understanding What Happened</h5>

<p>Did you notice something interesting? Our function printed two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>The function name (which we coded)</li>
<li>"Hello, beautiful learner" (added by our rule)</li>
</ul><br>

<p>This shows that our rule is working! Every time we create a new function, Cursor automatically adds our print statement. Pretty cool, right?</p>

<h5>Completion Checklist</h5>

<ul interactive>
    <li title="Rule modification">
        Verify the rule includes the print statement addition<br>
    </li>
    <li title="Function creation">
        Check that test_function.py exists and contains our function<br>
    </li>
    <li title="Test execution">
        Confirm the function runs and shows both print statements<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<h5>What's Next?</h5>

<p>We've seen a simple example of how rules can modify our code. Next, we'll explore more powerful capabilities of Cursor Rules, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple rule combinations</li>
<li>Rule for rules</li>
</ul>
