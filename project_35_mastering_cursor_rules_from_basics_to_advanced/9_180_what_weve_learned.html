<p>Let's review what we've learned.</p>

<h5>Concepts and Techniques</h5>
<p>Throughout this project, we've learned several key concepts and skills:</p>

- Understanding Rule Types and Scope<br>
  - Project vs Global Rules<br>
  - Meta-Rules for managing other rules<br>
  - Rule inheritance and organization<br>
  <br>
- Rule Configuration and Setup  <br>
  - Creating rules in .cursor/rules directory<br>
  - Configuring descriptions, globs, and always-apply settings<br>
  - Legacy .cursorrules file support<br>
  <br>
- Rule Development Workflow<br>
  - Testing and verification process<br>
  - Debugging with rule visibility<br>
  - Iterative refinement of rules<br>

<br>
<h5>Your First Rule Library</h5>

<p>Look at what you've built! You now have a collection of rules:</p>

1. <code>coding-standards.mdc</code> - Base coding standards<br>
2. <code>class-standards.mdc</code> - Class-specific rules<br>
3. <code>function-standards.mdc</code> - Function-specific rules<br>
4. <code>rule-visibility.mdc</code> - Rule application tracking<br>
5. <code>rules-location.mdc</code> - Rule organization<br><br>

<p>This is more than just a set of files - it's your first rule library! You can create your own rule collections to:</p>

- Share these rules with your team<br>
- Use them as templates for new projects<br>
- Build upon them for more specific needs<br>
- Create your own rule collections<br><br>

<h5>The Growing Power of Rules</h5>

<p>Right now, you might find yourself accepting only about half of the AI-generated code. This is normal! But here's the exciting part - as your rule library grows:</p>

- Code acceptance rate increases<br>
- Generated code becomes more consistent<br>
- Less manual modification needed<br>
- Faster development cycles<br>

<alert>Think of rules as an investment - the time you spend creating them now will pay off many times over in faster, more accurate development later.</alert>

<h5>Rules as Natural Language Specifications</h5>

<p>One of the most powerful aspects of Cursor Rules is how they let you define your codebase in natural language. Rules aren't just about code style - they can:</p>

- Define application architecture<br>
- Specify business logic<br>
- Enforce security requirements<br>
- Document expected behaviors<br>
- Fix functionality patterns<br><br>

<p>You now have the foundation to create powerful, maintainable rule systems that will make your AI-assisted development more efficient and effective. Keep building, keep refining, and watch your productivity soar!</p>
