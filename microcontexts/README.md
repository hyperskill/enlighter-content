# Microcontexts

Short `.md` files with essential context for working with specific technologies, tools, or projects.

Used:
- Inside [Enlight](https://enlightby.ai) (e.g., during learning or task solving)
- Externally in tools like Cursor, Warp, Winsurf — as quick reference

## Why

- Quick access to core info: how to build, test, deploy
- Useful as a starting point for learning a new tool
- Easy to extend and share

## Examples

- [uv.md](astral-sh/uv.md) — commands and tips for working with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- [mcp-python.md](modelcontextprotocol/mcp-python.md) — building and deploying Model Context Protocol in Python
- [typescript-sdk.md](modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk.md) — same for TypeScript

## How to use

Copy any `.md` file into your context-aware tool (e.g., Cursor) — and get helpful inline docs.
