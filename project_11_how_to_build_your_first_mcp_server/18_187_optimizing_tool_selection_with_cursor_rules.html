<p>In this stage, we'll create a special Cursor rule that provides detailed descriptions of all our MCP tools. This helps the AI make better decisions about which tool to call for specific tasks.</p>

<h5>Why Tool Descriptions Matter</h5>

<p>When you have multiple MCP servers with different capabilities, the AI needs context to decide which one is most appropriate for a given task. Without specific guidance, the AI might choose the wrong tool or mix incompatible tools together.</p>

<p>By creating a rule with detailed tool descriptions, we provide the AI with the necessary context to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make better decisions about which tool to use</li>
<li>Understand the strengths and limitations of each tool</li>
<li>Avoid unnecessary tool calls</li>
</ul><h5>Understanding Cursor Rules</h5>

<p>Cursor rules are special documentation files that provide guidance to the AI about your codebase, workflows, or tools. They're stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory.</p>

<p>Rules can define:</p>

<ul>
<li>Best practices for your project</li>
<li>Information about specific files or directories</li>
<li>Tool descriptions and usage guidelines</li>
<li>Code style preferences</li>
<li>Architectural patterns</li>
</ul><p>The AI references these rules when generating code or making decisions about which tools to use.</p>

<h5>Creating a Tool Descriptions Rule</h5>

<p>Let's create a rule file that describes our MCP tools:</p>

<callout type="chat">Create a file at .cursor/rules/mcp-tools.mdc with the following content:

This rule provides detailed descriptions of the available MCP tools to help the AI make better decisions about which tool to use for specific tasks.

## Echo MCP

The Echo MCP server provides simple echo functionality for testing and debugging. It has two main components:

<ul>
<li>**echo_resource**: Returns a message with "Resource echo:" prefix</li>
<li>**echo_tool**: Returns a message with "Tool echo:" prefix</li>
</ul>

Use Echo MCP when:
<ul>
<li>You're testing MCP connectivity</li>
<li>You need a simple response for debugging purposes</li>
<li>You want to verify that your MCP configuration is working</li>
</ul>

## Playwright MCP

The Playwright MCP server provides browser automation capabilities. It allows you to:

<ul>
<li>Navigate to URLs</li>
<li>Take screenshots</li>
<li>Click elements</li>
<li>Fill forms</li>
<li>Extract content from web pages</li>
</ul>

Use Playwright MCP when:
<ul>
<li>You need to interact with web pages programmatically</li>
<li>You want to extract information from websites</li>
<li>You need to automate browser actions (clicks, form filling, navigation)</li>
<li>You need to take screenshots of specific elements</li>
<li>You're testing a web application with predetermined steps</li>
<li>You require frame-by-frame control over browser actions</li>
</ul>

## When to Use Which Tool

<ul>
<li>**Echo**: For testing and debugging MCP connectivity</li>
<li>**Playwright**: For precise, step-by-step browser automation when you know exactly what actions to take</li>
</ul>

Example tasks for Playwright:
<ul>
<li>"Take a screenshot of the login button on example.com"</li>
<li>"Click the submit button after filling out the form"</li>
<li>"Check if element #results-container is visible"</li>
<li>"Fill in the registration form with test data"</li>
<li>"Navigate through a multi-step checkout process"</li>
</ul>

Make sure to create the `.cursor/rules` directory if it doesn't exist. Always apply the rule for every request.

<h5>Benefits of Tool Description Rules</h5>

<p>With our tool description rule in place, we should see several improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>More appropriate tool selection for specific tasks</li>
<li>Better explanations from the AI about why it's choosing a particular tool</li>
<li>More efficient workflows as the AI can choose the optimal tool without trial and error</li>
</ul><p>You can expand this rule as you add more MCP tools to your environment, ensuring the AI always has the context it needs to make intelligent decisions.</p>

<h5>What's Next?</h5>

<p>In the final stage we will take a look at what we have learned and will explore some resources to make your Cursor MCPs setup even stronger.</p>
