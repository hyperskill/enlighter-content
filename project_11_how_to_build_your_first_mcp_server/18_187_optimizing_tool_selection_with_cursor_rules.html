<p>In this stage, we'll create a special Cursor rule that provides detailed descriptions of all our MCP tools. This helps the AI make better decisions about which tool to call for specific tasks.</p>

<h5>Why Tool Descriptions Matter</h5>

<p>When you have multiple MCP servers with different capabilities, the AI needs context to decide which one is most appropriate for a given task. Without specific guidance, the AI might choose the wrong tool or mix incompatible tools together.</p>

<p>By creating a rule with detailed tool descriptions, we provide the AI with the necessary context to:</p>

- Make better decisions about which tool to use<br>
- Understand the strengths and limitations of each tool<br>
- Avoid unnecessary tool calls<br>

<h5>Understanding Cursor Rules</h5>

<p>Cursor rules are special documentation files that provide guidance to the AI about your codebase, workflows, or tools. They're stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory.</p>

<p>Rules can define:</p>

- Best practices for your project<br>
- Information about specific files or directories<br>
- Tool descriptions and usage guidelines<br>
- Code style preferences<br>
- Architectural patterns<br>

<p>The AI references these rules when generating code or making decisions about which tools to use.</p>

<h5>Creating a Tool Descriptions Rule</h5>

<p>Let's create a rule file that describes our MCP tools:</p>

<callout type="chat">Create a file at .cursor/rules/mcp-tools.mdc with the following content:

This rule provides detailed descriptions of the available MCP tools to help the AI make better decisions about which tool to use for specific tasks.

## Echo MCP

The Echo MCP server provides simple echo functionality for testing and debugging. It has two main components:

- **echo_resource**: Returns a message with "Resource echo:" prefix
- **echo_tool**: Returns a message with "Tool echo:" prefix

Use Echo MCP when:
- You're testing MCP connectivity
- You need a simple response for debugging purposes
- You want to verify that your MCP configuration is working

## Playwright MCP

The Playwright MCP server provides browser automation capabilities. It allows you to:

- Navigate to URLs
- Take screenshots
- Click elements
- Fill forms
- Extract content from web pages

Use Playwright MCP when:
- You need to interact with web pages programmatically
- You want to extract information from websites
- You need to automate browser actions (clicks, form filling, navigation)
- You need to take screenshots of specific elements
- You're testing a web application with predetermined steps
- You require frame-by-frame control over browser actions

## When to Use Which Tool

- **Echo**: For testing and debugging MCP connectivity
- **Playwright**: For precise, step-by-step browser automation when you know exactly what actions to take

Example tasks for Playwright:
- "Take a screenshot of the login button on example.com"
- "Click the submit button after filling out the form"
- "Check if element #results-container is visible"
- "Fill in the registration form with test data"
- "Navigate through a multi-step checkout process"

Make sure to create the `.cursor/rules` directory if it doesn't exist. Always apply the rule for every request.

<h5>Benefits of Tool Description Rules</h5>

<p>With our tool description rule in place, we should see several improvements:</p>

- More appropriate tool selection for specific tasks<br>
- Better explanations from the AI about why it's choosing a particular tool<br>
- More efficient workflows as the AI can choose the optimal tool without trial and error<br>

<p>You can expand this rule as you add more MCP tools to your environment, ensuring the AI always has the context it needs to make intelligent decisions.</p>

<h5>What's Next?</h5>

<p>In the final stage we will take a look at what we have learned and will explore some resources to make your Cursor MCPs setup even stronger.</p>
