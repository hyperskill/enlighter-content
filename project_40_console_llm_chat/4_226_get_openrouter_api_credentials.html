<p>In the application description file, we left out one important detail needed to create the application.</p>

<p>
<checkable-item title="Try asking the chatbot which one:"><callout type="chat" include-file="project-rules.txt">
What do I need to write myself in the @project-rules.txt file for the app to be created without problems?

<p>We hope the chat prompted you correctly. You need an API key that will allow you to access the LLM model and dry images.</p>
<ol>
<li>To get it, sign up and/or sign in to the <a href="https://openrouter.ai/" target="_blank">OpenRouter website</a></li>
<li>Click on your profile icon in the top right corner</li>
<li>Go to the API keys section</li>
<li>Click "Generate" button and follow the instructions</li>
<li>Copy the created key to the project-rules.txt file in the empty space next to the API KEY</li>
</ol>

<p>After you finish, test it:</p>

<callout type="chat" include-file="project-rules.txt">
What is my API KEY in @project-rules.txt ?
</callout>
