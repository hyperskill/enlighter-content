<p>You are ready to generate the application.</p>
<p>First, let's check:</p>
<ol interactive>
<li title="Brave Mode enabled"></li>
<li title="Junie is in Code Mode"></li>
</ol>

<alert>
    <details>
        <summary>What is Brave Mode?</summary>
        <div>
    <p>By default, Junie plays it safe. But if you enable <strong>Brave Mode</strong>, it can run terminal commands.</p>
    <p><img style="margin: auto; display: block; max-width: 500px;" src="https://ucarecdn.com/b1a6fc1a-8c7b-41dd-8190-5f856118e892/-/stretch/off/-/resize/2200x/-/format/webp/" alt="Brave Mode toggle in Junie"></p>
    <p>This can save tons of time, but remember: Brave Mode gives Junie superpowers, so use it when you're watching closely and have your project backed up.</p>
    <p>ðŸ§¯ Brave Mode is best when:</p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>You're experimenting in a separate branch;</li>
        <li>You're automating cleanup or setup tasks;</li>
        <li>You want Junie to explore or refactor at scale.</li>
    </ul></p>
    </div>
</details> 
</alert>

<p>If yes, it is enough to run this prompt:</p>

<callout type="chat" include-file="task-description.txt">
Create an app based on requirements task-description.txt. Make every piece of functionality testable by running terminal commands. Test the application.
</callout>

<callout type="chat" include-file="project-rules.txt">
Tell me how to run the application.
</callout>

<alert>
<details>
<summary>What if it doesn't work?</summary>
<div>
<p>If the application doesn't build for a very long time, or it builds but doesn't work as expected, try deleting all project files except project-rules.txt and start generating again.</p>
<p>AI is still not perfect. And a successful result is already very likely, but not mandatory. After several attempts you always get what you need.</p>
