<p>Chat knows how to create files and a whole application. Let's start small, ask it to create a file in the root of your project that describes in detail how the application works. We have prepared this file for you, you will need to edit it a bit in the future.</p>

<p>
<checkable-item title="Run this command in Chat:">
<warning>When the Chat finishes creating or editing files, you should accept the changes by pressing the "Accept" or "Accept All" button.</warning>

<callout type="chat">
Create a file named project-rules.txt in the root of my project. Add the following content to it:
The application is simple console chatbot that allows user to ask questions and get answers.

1. Use OpenRouter API by passing base url and API key to Langchain's implementation 
2. Use model "google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free"
3. Use OpenRouter API with provided credentials: 
    - API Key: 
    - API Host: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1 
    - Use Langchain for interacting with LLM
    - just pass provided base url and key. DO NOT EXTEND LANGCHAIN'S CLASSES
4. Create and always use Python virtual environment
5. No fixed package versions required
6. Run the application, test it in a console and fix all issues if needed
7. Provide user instructions to run the application

Learning how to write such descriptions is the most important part of working with code generation tools. Creating applications with AI is still software engineering. AI only helps with that. The good news is that AI is great at explaining complex terms and concepts. Put its abilities to the test. In the chat window, you can tag any file with the <code>@</code> symbol and ask it to clarify something or do something based on the description in that file. For example like this.

<warning>Don't forget to check that the file is added to the context, sometimes tagging stops working when inserted. Check it manually</warning>
<callout type="chat" include-file="project-rules.txt">
Explain to me all the technical terms and details in the @project-rules.txt file the way one would explain to a teenager with poor computer skills. Use metaphors and analogies. Make me understand how the application works, what different parts of it are responsible for, what libraries perform what role.
