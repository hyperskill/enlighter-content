<p>In this course, you will create a console-based chat application using a Language Learning Model (LLM). The application will allow you to have interactive conversations directly from your console.</p>
<p>Your application will be accessible through the console, where you can type messages and receive responses from the LLM. This project will help you understand how to interact with AI models in a console environment.</p>
<p>First, a bit of theory and at the same time familiarization with Junie functions</p>
<p>Ask Junie a question in chat and it will answer you, because it knows very well what an LLM is.</p>

Explain to me, as if I am 14 years old and don't know much about computers, what a Language Learning Model (LLM) is. Give me examples and metaphors to help me understand.
