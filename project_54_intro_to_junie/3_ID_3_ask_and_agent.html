<h5>From Inquiry to Action</h5>

<p>The core of working with Junie revolves around a powerful loop: using <b>Ask mode</b> to inquire and learn, and using <b>Agent mode</b> to plan and execute. Let's walk through a complete workflow where we first learn about a feature and then have the agent implement it for us.</p>

<h5>Step 1: Inquire with 'Ask' Mode</h5>
<p>Imagine you know that Junie can be customized, but you're not sure how. This is a perfect use case for 'Ask' mode. You can ask Junie about its own functionality. Let's find out about its project rules system.</p>

<callout label="Paste to Junie" type="chat">
What are Junie project rules? Explain their purpose, where the files should be stored, and what format they should use.
</callout>

<p>Junie will provide a detailed explanation. It will tell you that rules are stored in `.mdc` files inside a `.cursor/rules` directory, and that they are used to guide the agent's behavior to maintain project-specific standards. Now you have the knowledge.</p>

<alert>Think of 'Ask' mode as your built-in documentation and pair-programming partner, always ready to clarify concepts or details about your code or the tool itself.</alert>

<ul interactive>
  <li title="Ask Junie about project rules">
    Use the prompt above to learn about the rules system directly from the AI.
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Step 2: Plan and Execute with 'Agent' Mode</h5>
<p>Now that we know how to create a rule, let's delegate the task of creating one to the <b>Agent mode</b>. We'll create a rule that enforces a header comment on all new Python files. Based on the information from 'Ask' mode, we can formulate a precise request.</p>

<callout label="Paste to Junie" type="chat">
Switch to Agent mode. Create a project rule for Python files. The rule should state that all new Python files must start with a header comment: `# Copyright (c) 2024 MyAwesomeProject`. Create the necessary directory and file (`.cursor/rules/python_headers.mdc`).
</callout>

<p>Junie will now create a plan:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Check if the `.cursor/rules` directory exists.</li>
    <li>If not, create the directory.</li>
    <li>Create the file `python_headers.mdc` in that directory.</li>
    <li>Add the specified rule content to the file.</li>
</ol>

<p>After you approve the plan, Junie will execute it. In moments, your project has a new rule, created correctly according to the feature you just learned about. You can then test this rule by asking the agent to create a new Python file and observing that the header is automatically included.</p>

<ul interactive>
  <li title="Delegate rule creation to Agent mode">
    Use the prompt to have Junie create the rule file and directory.
  </li>
  <li title="Review the plan and execution">
    Approve the plan and verify that the file and its content are created as expected.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This "Ask -> Act" cycle is fundamental to working effectively with Junie. You use conversation to resolve ambiguity and gain knowledge, then use the agent to perform the work with precision and speed.</p>
