<h5>Automating Browser Interactions with MCP and Playwright</h5>

<p>A powerful application of <strong>MCP</strong> is browser automation for tasks like end-to-end testing.</p>

<p>By connecting Junie to the <strong>Playwright MCP server</strong>, you can delegate complex frontend testing scenarios to the agent, which it can execute and report on.</p>

<p>This approach is ideal for experienced developers who want to automate QA processes directly from their IDE. Instead of writing brittle test scripts, you can describe a user flow in natural language.</p>
<p>Let's see how this works.</p>

<h5>Configuring the Playwright MCP Server</h5>
<p>First, we need to add the Playwright MCP server to our project's configuration. This server is conveniently available as an NPX package, which simplifies the setup.</p>

<p>Ask Junie to create and populate the MCP configuration file for you.</p>

<callout label="Ask Junie to set up Playwright MCP" type="chat">
Create a project-level MCP configuration file at `.junie/mcp/mcp.json` and configure the Playwright server in it:

<code>
    {
        "mcpServers": {
          "playwright": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
              "@playwright/mcp@latest"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
</code>

</callout>

<alert>This command uses `npx` to download and run the Playwright MCP server on the fly. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. </alert>

<alert>If you are on Windows, Junie may need to configure the MCP server differently, via using cmd:

    <code>
        {
            "mcpServers": {
              "playwright": {
                "command": "cmd",
                "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"]
              }
            }
          }
    </code>
</alert>

<p>Once Junie creates the file, go to the settings and enable the MCP server. You can verify this in <code>Settings → Tools → Junie → MCP Settings</code>, where you should see the "playwright" server with a list of its available browser automation tools.</p>

    Use the prompt above and then verify in the Junie settings that the server is active.

<h5>Testing a User Flow with Junie and Playwright</h5>
<p>Now, let's use this new capability to test a real-world user flow. Imagine we have a web application with a login form. We can ask Junie to perform the test for us.</p>
<p>For this example, let's use a public demo site. Let's ask Junie to test the login functionality on saucedemo.com.</p>

<callout label="Ask Junie to test a login form" type="chat">
Using the Playwright tools, go to `https://www.saucedemo.com`. Enter the username `standard_user` and the password `secret_sauce`. Click the login button. After logging in, verify that the page contains the text "Products". Report back on whether the test was successful.
</callout>

<p>Junie will now use the Playwright MCP tools to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the URL.</li>
    <li>Locate the username and password fields and fill them in.</li>
    <li>Click the login button.</li>
    <li>Scan the resulting page for the verification text.</li>
    <li>Summarize the outcome in the chat.</li>
</ol>

<p>This demonstrates how you can offload repetitive but critical frontend testing to the agent, freeing you up to focus on development.</p>

<checkable-item title="Login flow test is successful">
    Execute the prompt and observe Junie controlling the browser to perform the test.
</checkable-item>

<p>This is just a glimpse of what's possible. You can create complex test suites, handle different user roles, and validate intricate UI states, all through conversational prompts with Junie.</p>

<p>You can create your own MCP servers or use existing ones to extend Junie's capabilities. Check out the <a href="https://enlightby.ai/projects/39">Enlighter page</a> for more information.</p>
