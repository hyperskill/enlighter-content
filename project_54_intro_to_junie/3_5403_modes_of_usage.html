<h5>From Inquiry to Action</h5>

<p>The core of working with Junie revolves around a powerful loop: using <strong>Ask mode</strong> to inquire and learn, and <strong>Code mode</strong> to plan and execute. Let’s walk through a complete workflow where we first learn about a feature and then have the agent implement it.</p>

<img style="margin: auto; display: block;" src="https://ucarecdn.com/6a80fba3-236f-4410-bf61-1e20f59a87b0/" alt="Modes of Junie usage" title="Modes of Junie usage">

<h5>Step 1: Inquire with 'Ask' Mode</h5>
<p>Imagine you know that Junie can be customized, but you’re not sure how. This is a perfect use case for <strong>Ask mode</strong>, where you can ask Junie about its own functionality. Let’s explore the project rules system.</p>

<callout label="Ask Junie about guidelines:" type="chat">
What are Junie guidelines? Explain their purpose, where the files should be stored, and what format they should use.
</callout>

<p>Junie will provide a detailed explanation: guidelines are stored in .md files inside a .junie/ directory and are used to guide the agent’s behavior to maintain project-specific standards. Now you have the knowledge.</p>

<alert><strong>Tip:</strong> Think of Ask mode as your built-in documentation and pair-programming partner—always ready to clarify concepts or details about the code you’re working on or the tool itself.</alert>

<h5>Step 2: Plan and Execute with 'Code' Mode</h5>
<p>Now that we know how to create a rule, we can delegate the task to Code mode. Switch to Code mode and ask Junie to write a guideline that enforces a header comment on all new Python files. Using what we learned in Ask mode, we can formulate a precise request.</p>

<callout label="Paste to Junie" type="chat">
Create project guidelines for Python files.
The guidelines should state that all new Python files must start with a header comment:
# Copyright (c) 2024 MyAwesomeProject
Create the necessary directory and file (.junie/guidelines.md).
</callout>

<p>Junie will create a plan. After you approve it, Junie will execute the task. Moments later, your project has a new guideline created correctly based on the feature you just learned about.</p>

<p><strong>Checklist:</strong></p>
<checkable-item title="Guideline file is created">
    Approve the plan and verify that the file and its content are created as expected.
</checkable-item>

<h5>Supercharging 'Code' Mode</h5>
<p><b>Code mode</b> has two powerful modifiers that you can toggle:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Brave Mode:</b> Executes terminal commands without asking for confirmation first. Ideal for trusted, repetitive tasks—use with caution.</li>
    <li><b>Think More Mode:</b> Gives Junie extra time and resources to analyze your request and codebase, often resulting in more thorough plans and higher-quality code. Best for complex or ambiguous tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p>This "Ask → Act" cycle is fundamental to working effectively with Junie. You use conversation to resolve ambiguity and gain knowledge, then use the agent to perform the work with precision and speed.</p>
