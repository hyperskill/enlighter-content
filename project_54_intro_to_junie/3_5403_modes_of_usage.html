<h5>From Inquiry to Action</h5>

<p>The core of working with Junie revolves around a powerful loop: using <b>Ask mode</b> to inquire and learn, and using <b>Code mode</b> to plan and execute. Let's walk through a complete workflow where we first learn about a feature and then have the agent implement it for us.</p>

<img style="margin: auto; display: block;" src="https://ucarecdn.com/6a80fba3-236f-4410-bf61-1e20f59a87b0/" alt="Modes of Junie usage" title="Modes of Junie usage">

<h5>Step 1: Inquire with 'Ask' Mode</h5>
<p>Imagine you know that Junie can be customized, but you're not sure how. This is a perfect use case for 'Ask' mode. You can ask Junie about its own functionality. Let's find out about its project rules system.</p>

<callout label="Ask Junie about guidelines" type="chat">
What are Junie guidelines? Explain their purpose, where the files should be stored, and what format they should use.
</callout>

<p>Junie will provide a detailed explanation. It will tell you that guidelines are stored in `.md` files inside a `.junie/` directory, and that they are used to guide the agent's behavior to maintain project-specific standards. Now you have the knowledge.</p>

<alert>Think of 'Ask' mode as your built-in documentation and pair-programming partner, always ready to clarify concepts or details about the code on which you are working or the tool itself.</alert>

<h5>Step 2: Plan and Execute with 'Code' Mode</h5>
<p>Now that we know how to create a rule, let's delegate the task of creating one to the <b>Code mode</b>. Switch to the Code, and ask Junie to write a guideline that enforces a header comment on all new Python files. Based on the information from 'Ask' mode, we can formulate a precise request.</p>

<callout label="Paste to Junie" type="chat">
Create project guidelines for Python files.
The guidelines should state that all new Python files must start with a header comment: `# Copyright (c) 2024 MyAwesomeProject`.
Create the necessary directory and file (`.junie/guidelines.md`).
</callout>

<p>Junie will now create a plan. After you approve the plan, Junie will execute it. In moments, your project has a new guideline, created correctly according to the feature you just learned about.</p>

<checkable-item title="Guideline file is created">
    Approve the plan and verify that the file and its content are created as expected.
</checkable-item>

<h5>Supercharging 'Code' Mode</h5>
<p><b>Code mode</b> has two powerful modifiers that you can toggle:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Brave Mode:</b> When enabled, Junie will execute terminal commands without asking for your confirmation first. This is useful for trusted, repetitive tasks but should be used with caution.</li>
    <li><b>Think More Mode:</b> This gives Junie extra time and resources to analyze your request and codebase, often resulting in a more thorough plan and higher-quality code. It's ideal for complex or ambiguous tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p>This "Ask â†’ Act" cycle is fundamental to working effectively with Junie. You use conversation to resolve ambiguity and gain knowledge, then use the agent to perform the work with precision and speed.</p>
