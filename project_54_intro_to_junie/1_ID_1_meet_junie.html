<h5>A Tool for Precision and Control</h5>

<p>Welcome to the introduction to Junie, the AI coding agent from JetBrains. This course is designed for experienced developers who want to leverage AI to accelerate their workflow without sacrificing control or code quality.</p>

<p><img style="margin: auto; display: block;" src="https://ucarecdn.com/ade4f450-f975-4e0d-b8cc-ac_1202fff400/" alt="JetBrains Junie" title="JetBrains Junie"></p>

<p>Unlike many AI assistants that focus on generating code snippets from vague prompts, Junie is built for professionals. It understands that in a mature codebase, context is everything. It operates with a "planning-first" mindset, ensuring you have full visibility and control before any changes are made.</p>

<h5>Why Junie is Different</h5>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Planning Before Execution:</strong> Junie's default behavior is to create a detailed execution plan for any significant task. You see the steps, the files to be modified, and the potential risks before giving the green light.</li>
  <li><strong>Deep IDE Integration:</strong> As a JetBrains tool, Junie is not just a chatbot in a side panel. It integrates deeply with your IDE's understanding of your projectâ€”from code navigation and inspections to version control.</li>
  <li><strong>Two Modes for Different Needs:</strong> You can switch between a conversational <b>Ask mode</b> for quick questions and a powerful <b>Agent mode</b> for autonomous, multi-step tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>You Are in Control:</strong> Junie doesn't commit code blindly. It presents you with a diff of the proposed changes, allowing you to review, request modifications, or accept them. You remain the author and final authority.</li>
</ul>

<alert>This course will walk you through setting up Junie, using its core features, and understanding the philosophy behind its design.</alert>

<p>In the next stage, we'll get your environment ready by installing the Junie plugin in your JetBrains IDE.</p>
