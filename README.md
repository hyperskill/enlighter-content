## üèóÔ∏è Content Structure

Each project follows this structure:

| Item              | Naming Convention | Example |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Project directory | `project_<PROJECT_ID>_<project_name_snake>` | `project_42_realtime_chat` |
| Stage html file   | `<order_num>_<STAGE_ID>_<stage_title_snake>.html` | `3_256_set_up_backend.html` |

**Key points:**
* Each project consists of 5-15 sequential learning stages
* Stages should take ‚â§20 minutes to complete
* Each stage should contain ‚â§400 lines of content
* More details on content structure can be found in `.cursor/rules/content_builder_instructions.mdc`
* New projects and stages IDs have to be mocked with `ID`, for example `project_ID_realtime_chat`
