<p>Now that we've created the HTML structure, let's continue developing our TodoMaster app by adding CSS styling. We'll see how Memory Bank helps maintain context between development sessions.</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Starting Where We Left Off</strong><br>

<p>Let's start a new session and ask Cursor to read our Memory Bank:</p>

<callout type="chat">
Please follow your custom instructions and read my Memory Bank files for TodoMaster. I'd like to continue by adding CSS styling to our app.
</callout>

<p>Cursor will respond with context from your Memory Bank, including the progress you've made so far.</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Adding CSS Styling</strong><br>

<p>Now, ask Cursor to help implement the CSS styling based on your Memory Bank context:</p>

<callout type="composer">
Based on our Memory Bank, please help me create the CSS styles for our TodoMaster app. We need:
1. Clean, modern styling with the Roboto font
2. Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
3. Styles for the task list, form, and filter controls
4. Visual indicators for task priorities
</callout>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Updating Memory Bank Again</strong><br>

<p>After implementing the CSS styling, update your Memory Bank:</p>

<callout type="chat">
I've implemented the CSS styling for TodoMaster. Please update our Memory Bank to reflect this progress.
</callout>

<p>Cursor will update the relevant files, particularly activeContext.md and progress.md, to reflect your progress on the CSS styling.</p>
