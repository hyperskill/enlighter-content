<p>Now that we've set up our Memory Bank, let's start using it to develop our TodoMaster app. We'll begin by creating the basic HTML structure.</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Starting a Development Session</strong><br>

<p>When starting a new development session with Cursor, first ask it to read your Memory Bank:</p>

<callout type="chat">
Please follow your custom instructions and read my Memory Bank files for the TodoMaster project. I'd like to start implementing the basic HTML structure.
</callout>

<p>Cursor will respond with something like:</p>

<p><em>"I've read your Memory Bank files for TodoMaster. I see this is a task management application using vanilla JavaScript with localStorage for data persistence. According to your activeContext.md, you're currently focusing on setting up the basic HTML structure. Let's get started on that."</em></p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Creating the HTML Structure</strong><br>

<p>Now, ask Cursor to help implement the HTML structure based on your Memory Bank context:</p>

<callout type="composer">
Based on our Memory Bank, please help me create the basic HTML structure for our TodoMaster app. We need sections for:
1. Header with app title and add task button
2. Task list view
3. Task creation/editing form
4. Filter controls
</callout>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Updating Memory Bank</strong><br>

<p>After implementing the HTML structure, update your Memory Bank:</p>

<callout type="chat">
I've implemented the basic HTML structure for TodoMaster. Please update our Memory Bank to reflect this progress.
</callout>

<p>Cursor will update the relevant files, particularly activeContext.md and progress.md.</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Completion Checklist</strong><br>
