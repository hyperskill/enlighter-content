<p>In this stage, we will create our Snake game.</p>

<h5>Convert instructions for Memory Bank into Cursor rule</h5>

<p>To make Memory Bank work better, let's convert instructions for Memory Bank into native .mdc Cursor rule.</p>

<p>If you aren't familiar with Cursor rules, you can learn more in <a href="https://enlightby.ai/projects/35">Mastering Cursor Rules: From Basics to Advanced</a> project.</p>

<p>Let's ask Cursor to create a rule based on memory_bank_instructions.md file. We will also delete memory_bank_instructions.md file after the rule is created.</p>

<callout label="Ask Cursor to create a rule based on memory_bank_instructions.md file">
1. Create folder .cursor/rules if it doesn't exist
2. Create memory_bank_instructions.mdc in .cursor/rules
3. Copy @memory_bank_instructions.md content into memory_bank_instructions.mdc with cat tool
4. Set 'always apply: true' for memory_bank_instructions.mdc - it's part of hidden markdown of .mdc files
5. Delete @memory_bank_instructions.md file
</callout>

<warning>
Sometimes, Cursor may not create the rule correctly. If this happens, you can create the rule manually by copying the content of memory_bank_instructions.md file into memory_bank_instructions.mdc file. Don't forget to set 'always apply: true' for memory_bank_instructions.mdc file.

<p>Let's also delete snake_game.md file since we don't need it anymore - it's replaced by Memory Bank files.</p>

<h5>Create Snake game with Memory Bank</h5>

<p>The funniest part of the project is now coming. We will create a Snake game with Memory Bank.</p>

<p>Let's ask Cursor to create Snake game based on rules and memory bank files.</p>

<p>We even don't need to specify the name of the app - Cursor will create it based on the rules and memory bank files.</p>

<callout label="Ask Cursor to create Snake game based on rules and memory bank files">
Please build an app based on your rules and memory bank
</callout>

<p>The process takes some time. After Cursor has finished, let's ask it to run the app.</p>

<callout label="Ask Cursor to run the app">
Run the app and show me the address where it is running
</callout>

<p>Let's open the address in the browser using provided link and see the result.</p>

<checkable-item title="Snake game is running"></checkable-item>

<p>One of the most important features of Memory Bank is that it can self-update - check the changes in progress.md file and activeContext.md file.</p>

<p>You can also ask Cursor to update it's state:</p>

<callout label="Ask Cursor to update Memory Bank">
Update memory bank
</callout>

<checkable-item title="Memory Bank is updated - progress.md and activeContext.md files are updated"></checkable-item>

<h5>What's next?</h5>

<p>In next stages, we will show how Memory Bank works while building new features - leaderboar and difficulty levels.</p>
