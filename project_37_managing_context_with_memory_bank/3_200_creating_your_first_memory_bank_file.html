<p>In this stage, we will create our Snake game.</p>

<h5>Convert instructions for Memory Bank into Cursor rule</h5>

<p>To make Memory Bank work better, let's convert instructions for Memory Bank into native <code>.mdc</code> Cursor rule. If you aren't familiar with Cursor rules, you can learn more in <a href="https://enlightby.ai/projects/35">Mastering Cursor Rules: From Basics to Advanced</a> project.</p>

<p>Let's ask Cursor to create a rule based on <code>memory_bank_instructions.md</code> file. We will also delete <code>memory_bank_instructions.md</code> file after the rule is created.</p>

<callout label="Ask Cursor to create a rule based on memory_bank_instructions.md file">
1. Create folder .cursor/rules if it doesn't exist
2. Create memory_bank_instructions.mdc in .cursor/rules
3. Copy @memory_bank_instructions.md content into memory_bank_instructions.mdc with cat tool
4. Delete @memory_bank_instructions.md file
</callout>

<warning><p>Sometimes, Cursor may not create the rule correctly. If this happens, you can create the rule manually by copying the content of <code>memory_bank_instructions.md</code> file into <code>memory_bank_instructions.mdc</code> file. Don't forget to set "Rule type: Always" for <code>memory_bank_instructions.mdc</code> file.</p></warning>

<checkable-item title="Old <code>.md</code> file is deleted"></checkable-item>

<p>We can also delete <code>snake_game.md</code> file since we don't need it anymore – it's replaced by Memory Bank files.</p>

<h5>Create Snake game with Memory Bank</h5>

<p>Let's ask Cursor to create Snake game based on rules and memory bank files.</p>

<p>We even don't need to specify any details – Cursor will create it based on the rules and memory bank files.</p>

<callout label="Ask Cursor to create Snake game based on rules and memory bank files">
Please build an app based on your existing rules and memory bank files
</callout>

<p>The process takes some time. After Cursor has finished, let's ask it to run the app.</p>

<warning>When you ask Cursor to run the app, pay attention to the command line where Cursor is running the app – it may ask you to install some packages or do some other actions required for the app to run.</warning>

<callout label="Ask Cursor to run the app">
Run the app and show me the address where it is running
</callout>

<p>Let's open the address in the browser using provided link and see the result.</p>

<checkable-item title="Snake game is running"></checkable-item>

<p>One of the most important features of Memory Bank is that it can self-update – check the changes in <code>progress.md</code> file and <code>activeContext.md</code> file.</p>

<p>You can also ask Cursor to update it's state:</p>

<callout label="Ask Cursor to update Memory Bank">
Update memory bank
</callout>

<checkable-item title="Memory Bank is updated – <code>progress.md</code> and <code>activeContext.md</code> files are updated"></checkable-item>

<h5>What's next?</h5>

<p>In next stages, we will show how Memory Bank works while building new features – leaderboard and difficulty levels.</p>
