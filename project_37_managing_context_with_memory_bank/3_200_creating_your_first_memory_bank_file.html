<p>Now that we understand the Memory Bank concept, let's start creating our files. We'll begin with the most important file: projectbrief.md.</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Setting Up the Rules Directory</strong><br>

<p>First, let's create a directory for our Memory Bank rules:</p>

<callout type="composer">
Create a directory structure for our Memory Bank rules:

mkdir -p .cursor/rules/memory-bank
</callout>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Creating projectbrief.md</strong><br>

<p>Now, let's create the projectbrief.md file for our TodoMaster app:</p>

<callout type="composer">
Create a file at .cursor/rules/memory-bank/projectbrief.md with the following content:

---
description: Project Brief for TodoMaster
globs: *.js, *.html, *.css
alwaysApply: true
---

# Project Brief: TodoMaster

## Overview

## Core Requirements
- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Organize tasks into categories
- Set due dates and priorities
- Mark tasks as complete

## Goals

- Make task management quick and efficient
- Help users stay organized

## Scope
- Web-based application
- Single-user focus
- Local storage for data persistence
- NOT included: user accounts, sharing features

## Success Criteria
- Users can manage tasks in under 3 clicks
- All data persists between sessions
- Interface works on both desktop and mobile
</callout>

<p>This file establishes the foundation of our TodoMaster project. It defines:</p>

- <strong>What</strong> we're building (a task management app)<br>
- <strong>Core features</strong> (task CRUD, categories, priorities)<br>
- <strong>Goals</strong> (clean interface, efficiency)<br>
- <strong>Scope</strong> (what's included and what's not)<br>
- <strong>Success criteria</strong> (how we'll know it's working well)<br><br>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Understanding the Rule Format</strong><br>

<p>Notice the metadata at the top of the file:</p>

```
---
description: Project Brief for TodoMaster
globs: *.js, *.html, *.css
alwaysApply: true
---
```

<p>This tells Cursor:</p>
- What this rule is for (description)<br>
- Which files it applies to (globs)<br>
- That it should always be applied (alwaysApply)<br><br>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Completion Checklist</strong><br>
