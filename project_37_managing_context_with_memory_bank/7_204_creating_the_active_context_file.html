<p>Now let's create the activeContext.md file, which tracks our current development focus and recent changes for the TodoMaster app.</p>

<h5>Understanding Active Context</h5>

<p>The activeContext.md file is the most frequently updated file in Memory Bank. It captures:</p>
- What you're currently working on<br>
- Recent changes you've made<br>
- Next steps in development<br>
- Active decisions being considered<br>
- Learnings and insights<br><br>

<h5>Creating activeContext.md</h5>

<p>Let's create the activeContext.md file for our TodoMaster app:</p>

<callout type="composer">
Create a file at .cursor/rules/memory-bank/activeContext.md with the following content:

---
description: Active Context for TodoMaster
globs: *.js, *.html, *.css
alwaysApply: true
---

# Active Context: TodoMaster

## Current Focus
- Setting up the basic HTML structure
- Creating the CSS styling for the task list
- Implementing the TaskModel for localStorage interaction

## Recent Changes
- Created project repository
- Set up Memory Bank documentation
- Defined initial architecture and design patterns

## Next Steps
- Implement basic HTML structure
- Create CSS styling with responsive design
- Develop TaskModel for CRUD operations
- Implement task creation form
- Add task list rendering

## Active Decisions
- Considering whether to use CSS Grid or Flexbox for the task list layout
- Evaluating the best structure for storing tasks in localStorage
- Deciding on the filtering implementation approach

## Learnings
- localStorage has a 5MB limit, which should be sufficient for our needs
- Using the repository pattern will make it easier to change storage mechanisms later
- Keeping the UI simple will make mobile responsiveness easier to implement

<p>This file captures:</p>

- Our <strong>current focus</strong> (HTML structure, CSS styling, TaskModel)<br>
- <strong>Recent changes</strong> we've made to the project<br>
- <strong>Next steps</strong> in our development plan<br>
- <strong>Decisions</strong> we're actively considering<br>
- <strong>Learnings</strong> we've gained so far<br><br>

<h5>Why This Matters</h5>

<p>The activeContext.md file is crucial for maintaining continuity between development sessions. It helps Cursor understand what you're currently working on and what you plan to do next.</p>

<h5>Completion Checklist</h5>
