<p>
  In this stage, we'll explore the structure of Memory Bank files and how they work together to
  maintain context for Cursor.
</p>

<h5>The Six Core Files</h5>

<p>Memory Bank consists of six markdown files organized in a hierarchical structure:</p>

<p>

    alt="Memory Bank File Structure"
    title="Memory Bank File Structure"
  />
</p>
<br />

<p>Let's examine each file:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>projectbrief.md</strong></li>
  <li>The foundation document</li>
  <li>Defines core requirements and goals</li>
  <li>Serves as the source of truth for project scope</li>
  <li>Created first and rarely changes</li>
  <br />

  <li><strong>productContext.md</strong></li>
  <li>The "why" of your project</li>
  <li>Explains why the project exists</li>
  <li>Describes user needs and problems solved</li>
  <li>Outlines user experience goals</li>
  <br />

  <li><strong>systemPatterns.md</strong></li>
  <li>The "how" of your project</li>
  <li>Documents system architecture</li>
  <li>Records key technical decisions</li>
  <li>Describes design patterns and component relationships</li>
  <br />

  <li><strong>techContext.md</strong></li>
  <li>The tools and technologies</li>
  <li>Lists technologies and frameworks used</li>
  <li>Documents development setup</li>
  <li>Records technical constraints</li>
  <br />

  <li><strong>activeContext.md</strong></li>
  <li>The current state</li>
  <li>Documents what you're working on right now</li>
  <li>Records recent changes and next steps</li>
  <li>Updated most frequently</li>
  <br />

  <li><strong>progress.md</strong></li>
  <li>The project status</li>
  <li>Tracks completed and in-progress features</li>
  <li>Lists known issues</li>
  <li>Records the evolution of project decisions</li>
</ol>
<br />

<h5>How These Files Work Together</h5>

<p>
  When you start a new session with Cursor, you'll ask it to read your Memory Bank files. Cursor
  will process these files in sequence, building a comprehensive understanding of your project.
</p>

<p>Here's how the information flows:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Project Brief</strong> → Establishes the foundation</li>
  <li><strong>Product Context</strong> → Adds user-focused perspective</li>
  <li><strong>System Patterns</strong> → Provides technical architecture</li>
  <li><strong>Tech Context</strong> → Details specific technologies</li>
  <li><strong>Active Context</strong> → Focuses on current work</li>
  <li><strong>Progress</strong> → Adds historical perspective</li>
</ol>
<br />

<p>
  This hierarchical approach ensures that Cursor has both the big picture and the specific details
  needed to assist you effectively.
</p>

<h5>Creating Your First Memory Bank</h5>

<p>
  Let's walk through creating a Memory Bank for a simple project. We'll use a todo list application
  called "TodoMaster" as our example.
</p>

<p>
  First, create a folder called "memory-bank" in your project directory. This will store all six
  files.
</p>

<p>Start by creating the project brief:</p>

<callout type="code">
  # TodoMaster Project Brief ## Overview TodoMaster is a simple, intuitive task management
  application designed to help users organize their daily activities. ## Goals - Create a clean,
  intuitive interface - Make task management quick and efficient - Help users stay organized ##
  Scope - Web-based application - Single-user focus - Local storage for data persistence - NOT
  included: user accounts, sharing features ## Success Criteria - Users can manage tasks in under 3
  clicks - All data persists between sessions - Interface works on both desktop and mobile
</callout>

<p>After creating the project brief, we can ask Cursor to help us create the remaining files:</p>

<callout type="chat">
  I've created a projectbrief.md file for my TodoMaster application. Based on this brief, can you
  help me create the remaining five Memory Bank files (productContext.md, systemPatterns.md,
  techContext.md, activeContext.md, and progress.md)?
</callout>

<h5>Key Benefits of This Structure</h5>

<p>This hierarchical structure provides several benefits:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong>: Each file has a clear, specific purpose</li>
  <li><strong>Progressive Detail</strong>: Information flows from general to specific</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Targeted Updates</strong>: You can update specific aspects without changing everything
  </li>
  <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Works for projects of any size</li>
</ol>
<br />

<h5>Completion Checklist</h5>

<ul interactive>
  <li title="Create memory-bank folder">
    Create a 'memory-bank' folder in your project directory<br />
  </li>
  <li title="Create projectbrief.md">
    Create a projectbrief.md file for your project using the example as a guide<br />
  </li>
  <li title="Ask Cursor for help">
    Use the provided callout to ask Cursor to help create the remaining files<br />
  </li>
  <li title="Review file structure">
    Verify that all six core Memory Bank files have been created<br />
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In the next stage, we'll set up custom instructions for Cursor to effectively use your Memory Bank
  files.
