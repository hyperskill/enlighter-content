<p>Now that we have our project brief, let's create the productContext.md file. This file explains why our TodoMaster app exists and who it's designed for.</p>

<h5>Understanding Product Context</h5>

<p>The productContext.md file answers these key questions:</p>
- Why does this project exist?<br>
- What problems does it solve?<br>
- Who are the users?<br>
- How should the product work from a user perspective?<br><br>

<h5>Creating productContext.md</h5>

<p>Let's create the productContext.md file for our TodoMaster app:</p>

<callout type="composer">
Create a file at .cursor/rules/memory-bank/productContext.md with the following content:

---
description: Product Context for TodoMaster
globs: *.js, *.html, *.css
alwaysApply: true

# Product Context: TodoMaster

## Problem Statement
Many people struggle to keep track of their tasks and responsibilities. Paper lists get lost, and complex task management systems have steep learning curves. TodoMaster solves this by providing a simple, digital solution for task management.

## User Personas

### Busy Professional (Alex)
- Has multiple responsibilities and deadlines
- Needs to prioritize tasks effectively
- Wants a quick way to see what's due soon
- Values simplicity and efficiency

### Student (Jamie)
- Juggles assignments across different courses
- Needs to organize tasks by subject/category
- Wants to track progress on longer projects
- Uses primarily on mobile devices

## User Journeys

### Task Creation
1. User opens TodoMaster
2. Clicks "Add Task" button
3. Enters task details (title, category, due date, priority)
4. Clicks "Save" to add the task to their list

### Task Management
1. User views their task list
2. Filters or sorts tasks as needed
3. Marks completed tasks with a single click
4. Edits or deletes tasks as required

## Value Proposition
TodoMaster provides a clean, intuitive interface for managing tasks without the complexity of enterprise solutions or the limitations of paper lists.

<p>This file provides important context about:</p>

- The <strong>problem</strong> our app solves<br>
- The <strong>users</strong> we're designing for<br>
- How users will <strong>interact</strong> with our app<br>
- The <strong>value</strong> our app provides<br><br>

<h5>Why This Matters</h5>

<p>The productContext.md file helps Cursor understand the "why" behind our project. This context is crucial for generating appropriate suggestions and code that align with our user needs.</p>

<h5>Completion Checklist</h5>

<ul interactive>
    <li title="Create productContext.md">
        Create the productContext.md file with the provided content<br>
    </li>
    <li title="Review user personas">
        Review the user personas to ensure they represent your target users<br>
    </li>
    <li title="Check user journeys">
        Verify that the user journeys cover the main interactions with the app<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>In the next stage, we'll create the systemPatterns.md file to define how our TodoMaster app will be built technically.</p>
