<p>Today we'll learn about Memory Bank - a powerful approach to maintaining context with AI coding assistants like Cursor.</p>

<h5>What You'll Learn</h5>

<ul>
<li>How to set up a Memory Bank for your projects</li>
<li>The structure and purpose of each core file</li>
<li>How to maintain and update your Memory Bank</li>
<li>How to build a real project using Memory Bank</li>
</ul>

<h5>What is Memory Bank?</h5>

<p>Memory Bank is a structured documentation system that allows Cursor to maintain context across sessions. It transforms Cursor from a stateless assistant into a persistent development partner that can effectively "remember" your project details over time.</p>

<p>When working with AI coding, you've likely encountered this common limitation: the AI has no memory of your previous conversations once you start a new session. This means:</p>

<ul>
<li>You need to re-explain your project repeatedly</li>
<li>The AI can't recall decisions you made together</li>
<li>You lose continuity in complex projects</li>
<li>Each session starts from scratch</li>
</ul>

<h5>How Memory Bank Solves This Problem</h5>

<p>Memory Bank addresses this limitation through a systematic approach to documentation:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Structured Documentation</strong>: A hierarchy of markdown files that build a complete picture of your project</li>
<li><strong>Context Preservation</strong>: Key information is stored in a format that's easy for both you and Cursor to reference</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Updates</strong>: Documentation evolves as your project progresses</li>
</ul>

<h5>Memory Bank is Not Magic</h5>

<p>It's important to understand that Memory Bank isn't a magical feature that gives Cursor perfect memory. It's a methodical approach to documentation that you maintain.</p>

<p>In the next stage, we'll dive deeper into the Memory Bank concept, exploring the file hierarchy and how the different components work together to maintain context.</p>

<h5>Setting Up Memory Bank</h5>

<p>
    To set up Memory Bank we will use <a href="https://github.com/ipospelov/mcp-memory-bank">Memory Bank MCP Server</a>. 
    It's a simple way to create a Memory Bank for your projects automatically based on provided context.
</p>

<p>First of all, we need to install uv and uvx tools to run Memory Bank MCP Server.</p>

<callout label="Install uv and uvx tool">
    Install uv and uvx tool if it's not installed yet
</callout>

<p>Then, we need to configure Memory Bank MCP Server.</p>

<callout label="Create mcp.json config with Memory Bank MCP Server">
1. Create .cursor folder in project if it doesn't exist.
2. Create mcp.json file in .cursor folder with the following content:

{
    "mcpServers": {
        "mcp-memory-bank": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "--from",
                "git+https://github.com/ipospelov/mcp-memory-bank",
                "mcp_memory_bank"
            ]
        }
    }
}

If mcp.json file is already created, just add "mcp-memory-bank" to the "mcpServers" array.
</callout>

<p>You will See a pop-up menu asking to enable a new MCP server</p>

<p>Now, we need to enable Memory Bank MCP Server in Cursor settings. Go to Cursor settings:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For Mac: Cursor → Settings → Cursor Settings → MCP Servers or <code>CMD⌘ + Shift + P</code> → Cursor Settings → MCP Servers</li>
    <li>For Windows: Settings → Cursor Settings → MCP Servers or <code>CTRL + Shift + P</code> → Cursor Settings → MCP Servers</li>
</ul>

<p>After that, you should see the green checkmark on the server name:</p>

    <summary>Setup with Smithery</summary>
    <p>MCP Server deployment is available on <a href="https://smithery.ai/server/@ipospelov/mcp-memory-bank">Smithery</a> platform.</p>
    <callout label="Ask Cursor to setup Memory Bank MCP Server with Smithery">
1. Create .cursor folder in project if it doesn't exist.
2. Create mcp.json file in .cursor folder with the following content:

{

            "your_smithery_key"
        ]
        }
    }
}

If mcp.json file is already created, just add "mcp-memory-bank" to the "mcpServers" array.
