<p>Now let's create the progress.md file, which tracks the overall status of our TodoMaster app development.</p>

<h5>Understanding Progress Tracking</h5>

<p>The progress.md file documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>What features are completed</li>
<li>What's currently in progress</li>
<li>What's planned but not started</li>
<li>Known issues and limitations</li>
<li>Key decisions made during development</li>
</ul><br>

<h5>Creating progress.md</h5>

<p>Let's create the progress.md file for our TodoMaster app:</p>

<callout type="composer">
Create a file at .cursor/rules/memory-bank/progress.md with the following content:

---
description: Progress Tracking for TodoMaster
globs: *.js, *.html, *.css
alwaysApply: true
---

</callout>

<p>This file provides:</p>

- A clear view of <strong>completed features</strong><br>
- Status of <strong>in-progress work</strong><br>
- List of <strong>planned features</strong><br>
- Any <strong>known issues</strong><br>
- A <strong>decision log</strong> tracking key choices<br><br>

<h5>Why This Matters</h5>

<p>The progress.md file helps Cursor understand the current state of the project and what's been decided so far. This context is valuable when you ask for help implementing new features or fixing issues.</p>

<h5>Completion Checklist</h5>

<ul interactive>
    <li title="Create progress.md">
        Create the progress.md file with the provided content<br>
    </li>
    <li title="Review feature status">
        Review the feature status to ensure it accurately reflects your project<br>
    </li>
    <li title="Check decision log">
        Verify that the decision log includes all important decisions made so far<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>In the next stage, we'll create the memory-bank-instructions.md file to tell Cursor how to use our Memory Bank.</p>
