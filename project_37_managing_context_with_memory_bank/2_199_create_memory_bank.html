<p>In this stage, we will create and configure Memory Bank files.</p>

<p>We will create a simple Snake game to demonstrate how Memory Bank works.</p>

<h5>Create a file with project requirements</h5>

<p>First of all, we will create a brief explanation of the project in free form. Don't overthink this step - we just need to provide a general idea of the project without any strict structure.</p>

<p>This file will be used to generate Memory Bank files.</p>

Project: Browser-based Snake Game (MVP)

1. Purpose & Scope
Purpose: deliver a minimal, fully playable Snake game in a modern browser.
Only includes the essential features needed for a functional Snake game; excludes all optional enhancements.

2. MVP Features
•	Game Initialization
•	Snake of length 3 appears centered on a 20×20 grid.
•	One food item spawns at a random empty cell.
•	Core Game Loop
•	Game updates every 150 ms by default.
•	Each tick: move snake, detect collisions, render state.
•	Controls & Direction Handling
•	Arrow keys (and/or WASD) change direction.
•	Disallow 180° reversals (e.g. left → right).
•	Collision Detection & Game Over
•	Hitting a wall or the snake’s own body triggers “Game Over.”
•	On game over: pause loop, show overlay with final score, disable input until restart.
•	Scoring Display
•	Current score (number of food eaten) updates in real time above or beside the canvas.
•	Restart Functionality
•	“Restart” button resets the game to its initial state without reloading the page.
•	Browser Compatibility
•	Support latest two major versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari.

3. Functional Requirements
•	FR-1: Initialize game state with snake length = 3 at grid center and one food item.
•	FR-2: Implement a game loop that runs at a configurable interval (default 150 ms).
•	FR-3: Capture and queue keyboard events for direction changes; prevent direct reversals.
•	FR-4: On each tick:
1.	Move snake head one cell in current direction.
2.	Check for wall or self-collision → if so, trigger game-over flow.
3.	If head lands on food: increment score, grow snake by one segment, spawn new food.
4.	Render updated snake, food, and score.
•	FR-5: Display a “Game Over” overlay with final score and a clickable “Restart” button.
•	FR-6: Reset all state (snake position/length, score, food) when “Restart” is clicked.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
•	Canvas scales to fit viewport while preserving cell aspect ratio.
•	Use ES6+ modules; separate game logic from rendering; include inline documentation.
•	All interactive elements reachable via keyboard; minimal ARIA labels on buttons.

5. Acceptance Criteria
•	Player can move the snake using keyboard; snake cannot reverse direction 180°.
•	Snake grows when eating food; score increments accordingly.
•	Colliding with wall or self immediately stops the game and displays final score.
•	“Restart” immediately resets and restarts gameplay.
•	Works smoothly in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari without console errors.

<h5>Use 'snake_game.md' file to create Memory Bank files</h5>

<p>Now, we will use 'snake_game.md' file to create Memory Bank files.</p>

<callout label="Ask Cursor to create Memory Bank files">
Based on @snake_game.md and your MCP tools, build a Memory Bank files
</callout>

<p>You will see the process of creating Memory Bank files in the chat: step by step it will create 7 files filled with content based on our requirements in @snake_game.md file:</p>
