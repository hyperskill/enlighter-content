<p>In this lesson, we will create a simple Python script that acts as a <strong>client</strong>. This client will discover our running Lyricist agent by fetching its public Agent Card. This will demonstrate a core part of agent-to-agent interaction: discovery.</p>

<h5>Step 1: Understanding Agent Discovery</h5>

<p>To communicate with an A2A agent, a client must first discover it. This process involves fetching the agent's public <strong>Agent Card</strong>, a JSON file containing metadata like its name, skills, and how to interact with it. The <code>a2a-sdk</code> provides a convenient <code>A2ACardResolver</code> for this purpose.</p>

<p>The client will perform one main action:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Discover the Agent:</strong> The client will fetch the agent's public Agent Card to learn its capabilities and address.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Step 2: Creating the Client Script</h5>

<p>Now, let's create a new file named <code>client.py</code>. This script will act as our client, discovering our Lyricist agent.</p>

<p>Inside <code>client.py</code>, we will use the <code>A2ACardResolver</code> to connect to the server we built in the last lesson and fetch its public Agent Card.</p>

<callout label="Ask your coding agent to create a client script">
Using the a2a-sdk library, create a client.py file that has httpx client and A2ACardResolver to discover the Lyricist agent.
</callout>

<summary>Full client.py code example</summary>
<pre><code>
import logging
import httpx

from a2a.client import A2ACardResolver
from a2a.types import AgentCard

PUBLIC_AGENT_CARD_PATH = '/.well-known/agent.json'

async def main() -> None:
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # Get a logger instance

    lyricist_agent_url = 'http://localhost:9999'

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as httpx_client:
        # Initialize A2ACardResolver
        resolver = A2ACardResolver(
            httpx_client=httpx_client,
            base_url=lyricist_agent_url,
        )
        logger.info(f'Attempting to fetch public agent card from: {lyricist_agent_url}{PUBLIC_AGENT_CARD_PATH}')
        public_card = (await resolver.get_agent_card())  # Fetches from default public path
        logger.info('Successfully fetched public agent card:')
        logger.info(public_card.model_dump_json(indent=2, exclude_none=True))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import asyncio

    asyncio.run(main())
</code></pre>
</details>
</alert>

<h5>Step 3: Run the Interaction!</h5>

<p>This is the moment where everything comes together. To see the discovery in action, you will need two terminals open.</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>In your first terminal:</strong> Make sure your agent server from Lesson 4 is running.
    <callout label="Terminal 1: Run the Server">
    python main.py
    </callout>
    </li>
    <li><strong>In your second terminal:</strong> Run the client script we just created.
    <callout label="Terminal 2: Run the Client">
    python client.py
    </callout>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>When you run the client, you will see it discover the server and print the public Agent Card of your Lyricist agent. You have just witnessed your first successful agent discovery!</p>

<h5>Outcome of This Lesson and What's Next</h5>

<p>Congratulations! You have successfully built a client and used it to discover a live agent. This is a critical step in building agent-to-agent applications and demonstrates a core part of the A2A protocol.</p>

<p>In our final section, we will recap everything we've learned throughout this tutorial and discuss the exciting future that this technology unlocks.</p>
