<p>In this course, you will create a console-based chat application using a Large Language Model (LLM). The application will allow you to have interactive conversations directly from the console.</p>
<p>Your application will be accessible via the console, where you can type messages and receive responses from the LLM. This project will help you understand how to interact with AI models in a console environment.</p>
<p>First, a bit of theory – and at the same time, an introduction to Junie's functions.</p>
<p>Ask Junie a question in the chat, and it will respond – it knows exactly what an LLM is!</p>

Explain to me, as if I am 14 years old and don't know much about computers, what a Language Learning Model (LLM) is. Give me examples and metaphors to help me understand.
