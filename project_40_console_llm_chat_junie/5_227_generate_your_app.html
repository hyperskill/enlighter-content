<p>You are ready to generate the application.</p>
<p>First, let's check:</p>
<ol interactive>
  <li title="Brave Mode enabled"></li>
  <li title="Junie is in Code Mode"></li>
</ol>

<alert>
  <details>
    <summary>What is Brave Mode?</summary>
    <div>
      <p>
        By default, Junie plays it safe. But if you enable <strong>Brave Mode</strong>, it can run
        terminal commands.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          style="margin: auto; display: block"
          src="https://ucarecdn.com/b1a6fc1a-8c7b-41dd-8190-5f856118e892/-/stretch/off/-/resize/2200x/-/format/webp/"
          alt="Brave Mode toggle in Junie"
          title="Brave Mode toggle in Junie"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        This can save tons of time, but remember: Brave Mode gives Junie superpowers, so use it when
        you're watching closely and have your project backed up.
      </p>
      <p>ðŸ§¯ Brave Mode is best when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You're experimenting in a separate branch;</li>
        <li>You're automating cleanup or setup tasks;</li>
        <li>You want Junie to explore or refactor at scale.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </details>
</alert>

<p>If yes, it is enough to run this prompt:</p>

<callout
  label="Execute prompt in code mode of Junie"
  type="chat"
  include-file="task-description.txt"
>
  Create an app based on requirements task-description.txt. Make every piece of functionality
  testable by running terminal commands. Test the application.
</callout>

<p>Junie will create a plan and then start generating the application.</p>

<p>
  <img
    style="margin: auto; display: block"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/ad9cb1e2-31b9-4f77-b8a6-5f6a1996eaee/"
    alt="Junie at work"
    title="Junie at work"
  />
</p>

<p>Once the application is generated ask Junie how to run it.</p>

<callout
  label="Execute prompt in ask mode of Junie"
  type="chat"
  include-file="task-description.txt"
>
  Tell me how to run the application.
</callout>

<alert>
  <details>
    <summary>What if it doesn't work?</summary>
    <div>
      <p>
        If the application doesn't build for a very long time, or it builds but doesn't work as
        expected, try deleting all project files except task-description.txt and start generating
        again.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI is still not perfect. And a successful result is already very likely, but not mandatory.
        After several attempts you always get what you need.
      </p>
