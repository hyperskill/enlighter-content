<p>The <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking">Sequential Thinking MCP</a> is a tool that helps break down complex problems into manageable steps, enabling a more structured and reflective approach to problem-solving. This stage will guide you through understanding and integrating this MCP in your GitHub Copilot workflow.</p>

<h5>Features:</h5>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking down complex problems into sequential steps</li>
<li>Revising and refining thoughts as understanding deepens</li>
<li>Creating alternative reasoning paths through branching</li>
<li>Dynamically adjusting the thinking process</li>
<li>Generating and verifying solution hypotheses</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5>Key Use Cases</h5>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Complex system design planning</li>
<li>Project architecture decisions</li>
<li>Code refactoring planning</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5>Setup Instructions</h5>

<p>You can set up the Sequential Thinking MCP using either npm or Docker. Choose the method that best suits your environment:</p>

<h5>NPM Setup</h5>
<callout type="chat" label="Ask Copilot">
Create or edit a file .vscode/mcp.json to include the following MCP setup:
{
  "servers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
If mcp.json file is already created, just add "sequential-thinking" object to the "servers" array and don't remove existing servers.
</callout>

<h5>Docker Setup</h5>

<callout type="chat" label="Ask Copilot">
Create or edit a file .vscode/mcp.json to include the following MCP setup:
{
  "servers": {
    "sequentialthinking": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "mcp/sequentialthinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
If mcp.json file is already created, just add "sequential-thinking" object to the "servers" array and don't remove existing servers.
</callout>

<h5>Practical Example: System Design Planning</h5>

<p>Let's use the Sequential Thinking MCP to plan the architecture of a new microservice. This example demonstrates how the MCP helps break down complex planning into manageable steps.</p>
