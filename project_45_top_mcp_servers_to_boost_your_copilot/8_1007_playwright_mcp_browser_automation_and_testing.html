<h5>Setup Instructions</h5>

<p>You can set up the Playwright MCP using NPX, which is the recommended method:</p>

<h5>NPX Setup</h5>
<callout type="chat" label="Ask Copilot">Create or edit a file .vscode/mcp.json to include the following MCP setup:

{
  "servers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
If mcp.json file is already created, just add "playwright" object to the "servers" array and don't remove existing servers.
</callout>

<p>For headless browser operation (no visible browser window), use:</p>

<callout type="chat" label="Ask Copilot">Create or edit a file .vscode/mcp.json to include the following MCP setup:

{
  "servers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--headless"
      ]
    }
  }
}
If mcp.json file is already created, just add "playwright" object to the "servers" array and don't remove existing servers.
