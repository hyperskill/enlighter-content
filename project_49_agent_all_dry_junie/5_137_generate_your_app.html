<p>You are ready to generate the application.</p>
<p>First, let's check:</p>
<ol interactive>
<li title="You have enabled Brave mode"></li>
<li title="Your Chat is in 'Code' mode"></li>
</ol>

<p>If yes, it is enough to run this prompt:</p>

<callout type="chat" include-file="project-rules.txt">
Create an app based on the requirements in project-rules.txt. Make every piece of functionality testable by running terminal commands. Test the application. Once the application passes all tests, run it.
</callout>

<p>If the Chat assistant has terminated but the application has not started (you have not seen any messages in the terminal that the application is running at <code>http://localhost:[PORT]</code>), simply enter an additional command in Chat.</p>

<callout type="chat" include-file="project-rules.txt">
Run this application. If an error occurred, try to fix it and then run the application again.
</callout>

<details>
<summary>What if it doesnâ€™t work?</summary>
<div>
<p>If the application doesn't build for a very long time, or it builds but doesn't work as expected, try deleting all project files except project-rules.txt and start generating again.</p>
<p>AI is still not perfect. And a successful result is already very likely, but not mandatory. After several attempts you always get what you need.</p>
<p>We have also noticed that sometimes the application is created but not launched. In this case, you just have to ask Chat: <code>run my application and fix the errors that occurred at startup</code>.</p>
