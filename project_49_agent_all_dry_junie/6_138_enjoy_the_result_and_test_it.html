<p>When the app is generated, you can upload any image to it and ask the chat to waterpaint it with additional instructions. Here are some examples for you to try and enjoy:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1467226632440-65f0b4957563" target="_blank">This is a free to use city view image</a>. Try to watercolor paint it in your app with the prompt: <code>Make a watercolor painting of this image on a sunset.</code>
</li>

<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/white-and-brown-long-fur-cat-ZCHj_2lJP00" target="_blank"> This is also a free kitten image</a>. Let's try to watercolor paint it with the prompt: <code>Make a watercolor painting of this kitten with a warm color pallette</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to watercolorpaint any of your own images. Experiment and enjoy. Keep in mind that image processing usually takes time. Be patient.</p>

<p>If you don't like the result, you can ask chat to explain the code in the <code>image_painter.py</code> file and fix it. You can also ask it to change the prompt to get a different result.</p>

<callout type="chat" include-file="image_painter.py">
  Explain the code in the image_painter.py file, and propose the meaningful changes to improve the image generation results.
</callout>
