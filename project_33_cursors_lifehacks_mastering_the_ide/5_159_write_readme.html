Draft a well-structured README to document your backend architecture, making integration with frontends easier. Example: For a REST API, a README might detail endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.

Interactive Example:
<callout-group>
<callout type="chat">Can you explain what key sections should be included in a backend README?</callout>
<callout type="composer">Generate an outline for a README file that covers backend architecture, endpoints, and integration steps.</callout>
</callout-group>
A clear README helps collaborators and your future self to quickly understand the system.
