Learn to differentiate and leverage global and local context files for storing project requirements and documentation. Example: A global context file might contain your overall coding standards and API keys, while a local context file holds specifics like endpoint requirements for your current project.

Interactive Example:
<callout-group>
<callout type="chat">What is the benefit of having both global and local context files?</callout>
<callout type="composer">Help me create a context file that distinguishes between global settings and project-specific details.</callout>
</callout-group>
This technique ensures that your project runs smoothly with all the necessary configurations in place.
