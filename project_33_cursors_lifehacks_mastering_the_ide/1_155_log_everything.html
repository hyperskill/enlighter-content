<p>Interactive Example:</p>
<callout-group>
<callout type="chat">How can I set up logging in a simple Python app so that errors are recorded?</callout>
<callout type="composer">Please generate code to log errors and unexpected behavior in a basic application. Include instructions to check those logs using the Composer.</callout>
