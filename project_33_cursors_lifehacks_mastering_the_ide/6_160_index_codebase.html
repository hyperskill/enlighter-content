Increase code discoverability by indexing your project files. Example: In a large project, an index file that maps out modules and key functions makes it easier to navigate the codebase.

Interactive Example:
<callout-group>
<callout type="chat">What are some ways to index a codebase for faster navigation?</callout>
<callout type="composer">Develop a strategy for creating an index of project files that enhances search and autocomplete features in Cursor.</callout>
</callout-group>
Indexing directly improves productivity when managing large projects.
