<p>This hack encourages you to build your application using Test-Driven Development. Example: Consider a calculator app where functions are verified through unit tests. If one part fails, the AI will identify the broken test and suggest a fix automatically.</p>

<p>Interactive Example:</p>
<callout-group>
<callout type="chat">How do I create a simple unit test for a function in Python?</callout>
<callout type="composer">Generate a template for a unit test that checks the output of a function in a small Python project.</callout>
</callout-group>
<p>Using TDD helps ensure that your project remains robust and that errors are caught early.</p>
