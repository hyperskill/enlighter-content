Leverage notepads as interactive sticky notes for important reminders, code snippets, or TODOs. Example: Stick a note with 'Review authentication module' to quickly recall pending tasks during development.

Interactive Example:
<callout-group>
<callout type="chat">Why are notepads useful in a coding workflow?</callout>
<callout type="composer">Show me how to create and organize notepads for a project in Cursor IDE.</callout>
</callout-group>
Notepads keep crucial information at your fingertips and reduce context switching.
