Enhance organization by tagging your project folders and files. Example: Imagine labeling folders 'backend', 'frontend', and 'tests' to quickly filter and locate relevant code portions within a large codebase.

Interactive Example:
<callout-group>
<callout type="chat">What are the best practices for tagging folders and files in a project?</callout>
<callout type="composer">Suggest a naming convention and tagging strategy for organizing a multi-module project.</callout>
</callout-group>
Tagging streamlines navigation and improves the overall structure of your project.
