Utilize Cursor's bug finder tool to detect and highlight potential issues in your code. Example: When running your app, the bug finder can alert you to a function that might throw an exception before it causes a problem in production.

Interactive Example:
<callout-group>
<callout type="chat">How does the bug finder help improve code quality?</callout>
<callout type="composer">Provide an example scenario where the bug finder detects a potential bug and suggest how to resolve it.</callout>
</callout-group>
Using the bug finder ensures that your application remains robust and error-free as it grows.
