Enable 'Loop on Yourself' (YOLO) mode to let Cursor refine its own outputs continuously. Example: Imagine your code generation has a minor flaw; YOLO mode allows the AI to auto-correct and optimize code without manual intervention.

Interactive Example:

<callout type="chat">How do I activate YOLO mode in Cursor IDE?</callout>
<callout type="composer">Provide steps to enable YOLO mode, ensuring that AI-refinement is operational.</callout>
</callout-group>
This mode is especially useful during rapid prototyping and iterative development.
