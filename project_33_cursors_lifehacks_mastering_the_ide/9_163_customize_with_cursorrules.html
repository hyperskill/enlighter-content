Define a .cursorrules file in your project root to tailor Cursor Chat behaviors and shortcut commands. Example: You can set rules to auto-format code or execute specific commands with a shortcut, boosting efficiency.

Interactive Example:
<callout-group>
<callout type="chat">How do I create a basic .cursorrules file, and what could it contain?</callout>
<callout type="composer">Provide an example of a .cursorrules file with rules for code formatting and command shortcuts.</callout>
</callout-group>
This customizability makes interacting with the IDE more intuitive and productive.
