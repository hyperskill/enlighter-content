<h5>Welcome to: Managing Context with Memory Bank in Junie</h5>

<p>In this course, you will learn how to harness the Memory Bank methodology to give Junie long-term knowledge of your project. By the end, you'll have a persistent context system that supercharges Junie&#39;s assistance across sessions.</p>

<h5>What You&#39;ll Learn</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Why context persistence matters when working with AI coding assistants</li>
  <li>How the Memory Bank folder structure works</li>
  <li>Maintaining and evolving your Memory Bank over the life-cycle of a project</li>
</ul>

<h5>What is Memory Bank?</h5>

<p>Memory Bank is a structured documentation system that helps Junie to maintain context across sessions. It transforms Junie from a stateless assistant into a persistent development partner that can effectively "remember" your project details over time.</p>

<p>When working with AI coding, you've likely encountered this common limitation: the AI has no memory of your previous conversations once you start a new session. This means:</p>

<ul>
<li>You need to re-explain your project repeatedly</li>
<li>The AI can't recall decisions you made together</li>
<li>You lose continuity in complex projects</li>
<li>Each session starts from scratch</li>
</ul>

<h5>How Memory Bank Solves This Problem</h5>

<p>Memory Bank addresses this limitation through a systematic approach to documentation:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Structured Documentation</strong>: A hierarchy of markdown files that build a complete picture of your project.</li>
<li><strong>Context Preservation</strong>: Key information is stored in a format that's easy for both you and Junie to reference.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Updates</strong>: Documentation evolves as your project progresses.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Memory Bank is Not Magic</h5>

<p>It's important to understand that Memory Bank isn't a magical feature that gives Junie perfect memory. It's a methodical approach to documentation that you maintain that enhances Junie's context management capabilities.</p>

<h5>Setting Up Memory Bank</h5>

<callout label="Ask Junie to copy Memory Bank repo">
Copy the 'src/mcp_memory_bank' folder from the repo:

https://github.com/ipospelov/mcp-memory-bank
</callout>


<h5>Limitations</h5>

<warning>Original MCP implementation works as an MCP server, which is currently not supported in Junie, but in this tutorial we'll show a workaround on how to achieve same performance without MCP server functionality.</warning>

<h5>Outcome</h5>

<p>In the next stage, we'll dive deeper into the Memory Bank concept, exploring the file hierarchy and how the different components work together to maintain context.</p>
