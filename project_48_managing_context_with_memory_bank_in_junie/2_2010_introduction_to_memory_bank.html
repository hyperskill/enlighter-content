<h5>Welcome to: Managing Context with Memory Bank in Junie</h5>

<p>In this course, you will learn how to harness the Memory Bank methodology to give Junie long-term knowledge of your project. By the end, you'll have a persistent context system that supercharges Junie&#39;s assistance across sessions.</p>

<h5>What You&#39;ll Learn</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Why context persistence matters when working with AI coding assistants</li>
  <li>How the Memory Bank folder structure works</li>
  <li>Maintaining and evolving your Memory Bank over the life-cycle of a project</li>
</ul>

<h5>What is Memory Bank?</h5>

<p>Memory Bank is a structured documentation system that helps Junie to maintain context across sessions. It transforms Junie from a stateless assistant into a persistent development partner that can effectively "remember" your project details over time.</p>

<p>When working with AI coding, you've likely encountered this common limitation: the AI has no memory of your previous conversations once you start a new session. This means:</p>

<ul>
<li>You need to re-explain your project repeatedly</li>
<li>The AI can't recall decisions you made together</li>
<li>You lose continuity in complex projects</li>
<li>Each session starts from scratch</li>
</ul>

<h5>How Memory Bank Solves This Problem</h5>

<p>Memory Bank addresses this limitation through a systematic approach to documentation:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Structured Documentation</strong>: A hierarchy of markdown files that build a complete picture of your project.</li>
<li><strong>Context Preservation</strong>: Key information is stored in a format that's easy for both you and Junie to reference.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Updates</strong>: Documentation evolves as your project progresses.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Memory Bank is Not Magic</h5>

<p>It's important to understand that Memory Bank isn't a magical feature that gives Junie perfect memory. It's a methodical approach to documentation that you maintain that enhances Junie's context management capabilities.</p>

<h5>Setting Up Memory Bank</h5>

<p>
  To set up Memory Bank we will use <a href="https://github.com/ipospelov/mcp-memory-bank">Memory Bank MCP Server</a>. 
  It's a simple way to create a Memory Bank for your projects automatically based on provided context.
</p>

<p>First of all, we need to install uv and uvx tools to run Memory Bank MCP Server.</p>

<callout label="Install uv and uvx tool">
  Install uv and uvx tool if it's not installed yet
</callout>

<p>Then, we need to configure Memory Bank MCP Server.</p>

<callout label="Create mcp.json config with Memory Bank MCP Server">
1. Create .junie/mcp/ folder in project if it doesn't exist.
2. Create mcp.json file in this folder with the following content:

{
    "mcpServers": {
        "mcp-memory-bank": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "--from",
                "git+https://github.com/ipospelov/mcp-memory-bank",
                "mcp_memory_bank"
            ]
        }
    }
}

If mcp.json file is already created, just add "mcp-memory-bank" to the "mcpServers" array.
</callout>

<checkable-item title="The file ./junie/mcp/mcp.json is created and has the proper content"></checkable-item>

<p>Now we need to activate Memory Bank MCP Server in Junie settings. Go to <strong>Settings → Tools → Junie → MCP settings</strong> and click on the <strong>Edit config</strong> button.</p>

<p>Toggle <strong>mcp-memory-bank</strong> and click the <strong>Apply</strong> button.</p>

<p>After that the status icon for the Memory bank MCP server should change to green and you can see the list of available tools in the settings.</p>

</p>

<checkable-item title="Memory Bank MCP Server is activated in Junie settings"></checkable-item>

<p>In the next stage, we'll dive deeper into the Memory Bank concept, exploring the file hierarchy and how the different components work together to maintain context.</p>
