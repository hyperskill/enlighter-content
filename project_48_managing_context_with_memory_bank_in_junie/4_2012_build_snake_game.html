<p>In this stage, we will create our Snake game.</p>

<h5>Create Snake game with Memory Bank</h5>

<p>Ask Junie to build the game using the information contained in your Memory Bank.</p>

<p>We even don't need to specify any details – Junie will create it based on Memory Bank files.</p>

<callout label="Ask Junie to create the Snake game based on Memory Bank files">
Build a Snake Game app based on your existing memory bank files.
</callout>

<p>The process might take some time. After Junie has finished, let's ask it to run the app.</p>

<warning>When you ask Junie to run the app, pay attention to the command line – it may ask you to install some packages or do some other actions required for the app to run.</warning>

<callout label="Ask Junie to run the app">
Run the app and show me the address where it is running.
</callout>

<p>Let's open the address in the browser using provided link and see the result.</p>

<p>One of the most important features of Memory Bank is that it can self-update – check the changes in <code>progress.md</code> file and <code>activeContext.md</code> file.</p>

<p>You can also ask Junie to update its state:</p>

<callout label="Ask Junie to update Memory Bank">
Update memory bank files to reflect the current state of the project.
</callout>

<checkable-item title="Memory Bank is updated – <code>progress.md</code> and <code>activeContext.md</code> files are updated"></checkable-item>

<h5>What's next?</h5>

<p>In next stages, we will see how Memory Bank works while adding new features – leaderboard and difficulty levels.</p>
