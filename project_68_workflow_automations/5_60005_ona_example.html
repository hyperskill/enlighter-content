<h5>Hands-On with Ona AI: Automate Invoices with One Sentence</h5>
<p>Welcome to your first project with Ona AI. In this lesson, you'll experience firsthand how incredibly simple it is to create a powerful automation using natural language. Our goal is to build an "Invoice Processor" that automatically extracts information from new invoices in your email and logs it in a Google Sheet. This is a common business task that can save hours of manual data entry, and we're going to build it with a single instruction.</p>

<h5>Step 1: The Prompt â€“ Describing Your Goal in Plain English</h5>
<p>This is the core of the Ona AI experience. Instead of building a workflow, we will simply tell Ona AI what we want to achieve. Navigate to the workflow creator in your Ona AI dashboard.</p>
<p>In the prompt box, type the following instruction:</p>
<p><strong>"When a new email with an invoice arrives in my Gmail, extract the invoice number, the total amount, and the sender's name, and then add this information to a new row in my 'Invoices' Google Sheet."</strong></p>
<p>That's it. This single sentence contains the trigger (a new email), the logic (extracting specific data), and the action (adding a row to a Google Sheet).</p>

<h5>Step 2: Connecting Your Apps</h5>
<p>Once you submit your prompt, Ona AI will analyze it and identify the apps you mentioned (Gmail and Google Sheets). If you haven't connected them before, Ona AI will prompt you to authorize access. This is a secure, one-time process that allows Ona AI to work with your accounts.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the "Connect" button for Gmail and follow the instructions to sign in to your Google account.</li>
    <li>Do the same for Google Sheets.</li>
    <li>You may also be asked to specify which spreadsheet and sheet you want to use (e.g., "Invoices" spreadsheet, "Sheet1").</li>
</ol>

<h5>Step 3: Reviewing and Activating the Automation</h5>
<p>After you've connected your apps, Ona AI will instantly translate your natural language prompt into a functional workflow. It will show you a summary of the trigger and the actions it has prepared. This gives you a chance to confirm that it correctly understood your request.</p>
<p>If everything looks correct, simply activate the automation. Your new "Invoice Processor" is now live and will run in the background, watching for new invoices.</p>

<h5>Step 4: See it in Action</h5>
<p>To test your workflow, send an email with a sample invoice to yourself. Within moments, you should see a new row appear in your "Invoices" Google Sheet, populated with the correct invoice number, total amount, and sender name. You've successfully automated a complex data entry task without touching a single node or writing a line of code.</p>

<p>You've now seen the incredible power and simplicity of building with natural language. In our final lesson, we'll summarize our journey through both visual and conversational automation.</p>
