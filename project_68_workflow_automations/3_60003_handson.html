<h5>Your First AI Agent: The n8n Expert</h5>
<p>It's time to go beyond simple automation and build your first intelligent agent. In this lesson, we will create an "n8n Expert," an AI agent that can answer your questions about n8n by using web search. This project will introduce you to the powerful AI Agent node, showing you how to give an AI model tools to perform tasks and solve problems autonomously. This is a foundational step towards building more complex and capable AI systems.</p>
<p>This tutorial is designed for beginners. We will walk through each step, from setting up the agent to giving it tools and testing its knowledge. Let's build your AI assistant!</p>

<h5>Step 1: The Manual Trigger – Asking Your Question</h5>
<p>Every workflow needs a starting point. We'll use a manual trigger, which lets us kick off the workflow on demand and provide our agent with a question.</p>
<ol>
    <li>On a new n8n canvas, click the "Add first step" button and select the "Manual" trigger. This is perfect for tasks you want to run by hand.</li>
</ol>
<p>This node will serve as our input interface for asking the AI agent a question.</p>

<h5>Step 2: The AI Agent – The Brain of the Operation</h5>
<p>Now, let's add the core component: the AI Agent. This special node can use language models and tools to reason and act.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the "+" icon after the trigger and search for the "AI Agent" node.</li>
    <li><strong>Choose a Model:</strong> In the configuration panel, select your preferred language model. For this example, we will use "OpenAI". You'll need to create credentials using your OpenAI API key.</li>
    <li><strong>Give it Instructions:</strong> In the "System Prompt" field, tell the agent what its role is. Enter this: <code>You are an expert on n8n, the workflow automation tool. You will answer questions factually and concisely.</code></li>
    <li><strong>Give it a Tool:</strong> An agent's real power comes from its tools. Click "Add Tool" and select the "Web Search" tool. This allows the agent to look up information online to answer questions.</li>
    <li><strong>Set the Input:</strong> We need to tell the agent what the user's question is. In the "Input" field, use the following expression to get the question from our trigger: <code>{{ $json.question }}</code></li>
</ol>

<h5>Step 3: The Sticky Note – Displaying the Answer</h5>
<p>To easily see the agent's final answer, we'll use a Sticky Note node. This is a great way to display output directly on your canvas.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Add a new node after the AI Agent and search for "Sticky Note".</li>
    <li>In the "Text" field of the Sticky Note, we need to display the agent's output. Use this expression: <code>{{ $('AI Agent').item.json.output }}</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Your complete workflow should now look like this: Manual Trigger → AI Agent → Sticky Note.</p>

<h5>Step 4: Testing Your n8n Expert</h5>
<p>With all the pieces in place, it's time to ask your agent a question.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go back to the "Manual" trigger node. In the JSON input area, enter a question. For example: <code>{"question": "What are the different types of triggers in n8n?"}</code></li>
    <li>Click the "Execute Workflow" button at the bottom right.</li>
    <li>You can watch as the AI Agent "thinks"—it will first decide to use the Web Search tool, perform the search, and then formulate an answer based on the results.</li>
    <li>Once the workflow is complete, the Sticky Note will update to show the agent's final, well-researched answer.</li>
</ol>

<p>Congratulations! You have successfully built a functional AI agent. You've learned how to instruct an AI, provide it with tools, and use it to solve a problem. This is a massive step forward in your automation journey.</p>
<p>In our final lesson, we'll summarize what we've covered and look at the exciting possibilities that lie ahead.</p>
