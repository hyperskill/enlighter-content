<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>Welcome to the new era of automation! We are living through a technological revolution where Artificial Intelligence is not just a buzzword, but a transformative force. This guide is your entry point into leveraging this power. We're moving beyond simple, rule-based automation into the realm of intelligent, adaptive systems. These next-generation automations can understand context, make decisions, and handle complex tasks, fundamentally changing how we work, innovate, and grow.</p>
<p>This course is designed to introduce you to the exciting world of AI-powered workflow automation. Forget tedious, repetitive tasks. It's time to build smart workflows that act as true digital assistants. We will explore powerful platforms like the visual builder n8n and the conversational Ona AI to bring these intelligent automations to life, showcasing two different but equally revolutionary approaches to building.</p>

<h5>Our Study Path</h5>

<p>This journey will equip you with the foundational knowledge to architect sophisticated, AI-driven workflows using the industry's leading tools. We will cover both visual, node-based development and cutting-edge, natural language-based creation.</p>

<p>Here’s a look at what we will cover:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lesson 1: The New Age of Automation</strong><br>An introduction to what AI-powered workflow automation is, why it’s a game-changer, and the incredible new possibilities it unlocks.</li>
    <li><strong>Lesson 2: Introducing n8n: Your Gateway to Intelligent Automation</strong><br>Get acquainted with the n8n interface and its visual, node-based approach to building powerful workflows.</li>
    <li><strong>Lesson 3: Your First AI Agent: The n8n Expert</strong><br>A step-by-step guide to building a research assistant in n8n that uses AI and web search to answer your questions.</li>
    <li><strong>Lesson 4: The Next Leap: Introducing Ona AI</strong><br>Discover the future of automation by building workflows with natural language, simply by describing what you want to achieve.</li>
    <li><strong>Lesson 5: Hands-On with Ona AI: Automate Invoices with One Sentence</strong><br>A practical project where we build a complete invoice processing workflow using a single line of text in Ona AI.</li>
    <li><strong>Summary & Key Takeaways</strong><br>We'll conclude with a wrap-up of the main concepts, empowering you to choose the right tool and create your own intelligent automations.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Setting Up for the Exercises</h5>

<p>To get the most out of the practical examples, you will need to set up free accounts for the platforms we'll be using. This will take just a few minutes and will allow you to build along with the lessons.</p>
