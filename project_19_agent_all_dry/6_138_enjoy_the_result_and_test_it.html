<p>When the app is generated, you can upload any image to it and ask the chat to dry it with additional instructions. Here are some examples for you to try and enjoy:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/red-tomato-on-gray-concrete-surface-OlXUUQedQyM" target="_blank">This is a free to use tomato image</a>. Try to dry it in your app with the prompt: <code>This is a whole medium-sized red tomato. Make it sun-dried on a medium level.</code>
</li>

<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/white-and-brown-long-fur-cat-ZCHj_2lJP00" target="_blank">This is also a free kitten image</a>. Just for fun, try drying it in your app with the prompt: <code>This is a tiny kitten. Please dry it and make it completely dehydrated.</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to dry any of your own images. Experiment and enjoy. Keep in mind that image processing usually takes time. Be patient.</p>
