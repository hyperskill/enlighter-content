<p>In this course, you will create an AI agent. It will be very simple, performing just one task - drying the objects in your pictures. Yes, yes, this is a mock application to figure out how things work here.</p>
<p>Your application will be accessible through a browser, it will have a chat window where you can specify how best to dry the objects in the picture, a form for uploading the image and a result window. All of this will generate a Cursor for you.</p>
<p>First, a bit of theory and at the same time familiarization with Cursor functions</p>
<p>Ask Cursor a question in chat and he will answer you, because he knows very well what an AI agent is.</p>
