<p>In this stage, we will add new features to our game – leaderboard and difficulty levels.</p>

<h5>Create difficulty levels</h5>

<p>Let's show how Memory Bank works while building new feature – difficulty levels.</p>

<callout label="Ask Copilot to create difficulty levels">
Create difficulty levels for the game. There should be 3 levels: easy, medium and hard with different speeds of the snake. Update memory bank file after you finished.
</callout>

<p>After the job is done, let's ask Copilot to run the app.</p>

<callout label="Ask Copilot to run the app">
    Run the app and show me the address where it is running
</callout>  

<checkable-item title="Difficulty levels are added to the game"></checkable-item>

<p>Take a look at changes in Memory Bank files: you can probably see updates in <code>progress.md</code>, <code>activeContext.md</code>, <code>productContext.md</code> and <code>projectbrief.md</code> files.</p>

<h5>Create leaderboard</h5>

<p>Let's add leaderboard to the game. </p>

<callout label="Ask Copilot to create leaderboard">
    Create leaderboard for the game. Store leaderboard in browser local storage. Update memory bank file after you finished.
</callout>

<p>After the job is done, let's ask Copilot to run the app.</p>

<callout label="Ask Copilot to run the app">
    Run the app and show me the address where it is running.
</callout>

<checkable-item title="Leaderboard is added to the game."></checkable-item>

<p>The power of Memory Bank is that every change is recorded and you don't need to explain project's context every time you started new session.</p>

<p>Let's ask Copilot to show what are the next steps:</p>

<callout label="Ask Copilot to show what are the next steps">
    What are the next steps in my project?
</callout>

<checkable-item title="Next steps are shown"></checkable-item>

<p>This way you can iterate over your project and add new features keeping the context of the project without any additional effort. Isn't it great?</p>

<p>Let's move further to the final stage of the project.</p>
