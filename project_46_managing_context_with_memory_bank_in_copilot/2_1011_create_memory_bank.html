<p>In this stage you will generate a working Memory Bank for a simple <em>Snake</em> game. This hands-on example shows how Copilot and the Memory Bank MCP collaborate.</p>

<h5>Create a project brief</h5>

<p>We begin by writing a short, free-form description of the game. Copilot will later transform this brief into the full Memory Bank hierarchy, so don&#39;t worry about perfect structure—just outline the essentials.</p>

  Project: Browser-based Snake Game (MVP)
  
  1. Purpose & Scope
  Purpose: deliver a minimal, fully playable Snake game in a modern browser.
  Only includes the essential features needed for a functional Snake game; excludes all optional enhancements.
  
  2. MVP Features
  •	Game Initialization
  •	Snake of length 3 appears centered on a 20×20 grid.
  •	One food item spawns at a random empty cell.
  •	Core Game Loop
  •	Game updates every 150 ms by default.
  •	Each tick: move snake, detect collisions, render state.
  •	Controls & Direction Handling
  •	Arrow keys (and/or WASD) change direction.
  •	Disallow 180° reversals (e.g. left → right).
  •	Collision Detection & Game Over
  •	Hitting a wall or the snake's own body triggers "Game Over."
  •	On game over: pause loop, show overlay with final score, disable input until restart.
  •	Scoring Display
  •	Current score (number of food eaten) updates in real time above or beside the canvas.
  •	Restart Functionality
  •	"Restart" button resets the game to its initial state without reloading the page.
  •	Browser Compatibility
  •	Support latest two major versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari.
  
  3. Functional Requirements
  •	FR-1: Initialize game state with snake length = 3 at grid center and one food item.
  •	FR-2: Implement a game loop that runs at a configurable interval (default 150 ms).
  •	FR-3: Capture and queue keyboard events for direction changes; prevent direct reversals.
  •	FR-4: On each tick:
  1.	Move snake head one cell in current direction.
  2.	Check for wall or self-collision → if so, trigger game-over flow.
  3.	If head lands on food: increment score, grow snake by one segment, spawn new food.
  4.	Render updated snake, food, and score.
  •	FR-5: Display a "Game Over" overlay with final score and a clickable "Restart" button.
  •	FR-6: Reset all state (snake position/length, score, food) when "Restart" is clicked.
  
  4. Non-Functional Requirements
  •	Canvas scales to fit viewport while preserving cell aspect ratio.
  •	Use ES6+ modules; separate game logic from rendering; include inline documentation.
  •	All interactive elements reachable via keyboard; minimal ARIA labels on buttons.
  
  5. Acceptance Criteria
  •	Player can move the snake using keyboard; snake cannot reverse direction 180°.
  •	Snake grows when eating food; score increments accordingly.
  •	Colliding with wall or self immediately stops the game and displays final score.
  •	"Restart" immediately resets and restarts gameplay.
  •	Works smoothly in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari without console errors.

<h5>Memory Bank files creation</h5>

<p>Now, we will use <code>snake_game.md</code> file to create Memory Bank files.</p>

<callout label="Ask Copilot to create Memory Bank files">
Based on snake_game.md create memory bank files. Use Memory Bank MCP.
</callout>

<p>You will see the process of creating Memory Bank files in the chat: step by step it will create 7 files filled with content based on our requirements in @snake_game.md file:</p>
