<p>The <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory">Knowledge Graph Memory MCP</a> is a tool that provides persistent memory capabilities using a local knowledge graph. This powerful server enables Cursor to remember information about users and projects across chat sessions, creating a more personalized and contextually aware experience. This stage will guide you through setting up and utilizing this MCP in your Cursor workflow.</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Features:</strong><br>
- Store information in a structured knowledge graph<br>
- Create and manage entities with unique identifiers and types<br>
- Define relationships between entities<br>
- Add and manage observations (discrete pieces of information)<br>
- Search and retrieve stored knowledge<br>
- Maintain context across multiple chat sessions<br><br>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Key Use Cases</strong><br>
- Personalized user interactions<br>
- Long-term project context maintenance<br>
- Storing coding standards and preferences<br>
- Building comprehensive knowledge of project requirements<br>
- Tracking relationships between project components<br><br>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Setup Instructions</strong><br>

<p>You can set up the Knowledge Graph Memory MCP using either NPX or Docker. Choose the method that best suits your environment:</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">NPX Setup</strong><br>
<callout type="chat">Create or edit a file .cursor/mcp.json to include the following MCP setup:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"
      ]
    }
  }
}</callout>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Docker Setup</strong><br>
<callout type="chat">Create or edit a file .cursor/mcp.json to include the following MCP setup:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", 
        "-i", 
        "-v", 
        "claude-memory:/app/dist", 
        "--rm", 
        "mcp/memory"
      ]
    }
  }
}</callout>

<p>You can also customize the storage location using environment variables:</p>

<callout type="chat">Create or edit a file .cursor/mcp.json to include the following MCP setup:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_FILE_PATH": "/path/to/custom/memory.json"
      }
    }
  }
}</callout>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Practical Example: Knowledge Management</strong><br>

<callout type="chat">Create a knowledge graph about our project team. Store that John is a frontend developer who knows React and TypeScript. Sarah is a backend developer who works with Node.js. They are both working on the e-commerce project that started in January 2023.</callout>

<p>To test the setup, you can use the following request:</p>

<callout type="chat">What do you know about my team? Check your memory</callout>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Core Knowledge Graph Concepts</strong><br>

<p>The Knowledge Graph Memory MCP organizes information using three primary components:</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Entities</strong><br>
- Primary nodes in the knowledge graph<br>
- Each has a unique name (identifier)<br>
- Defined by an entity type (e.g., "person", "organization", "project")<br>
- Contains a list of observations (discrete pieces of information)<br>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Relations</strong><br>
- Directed connections between entities<br>
- Always stored in active voice<br>
- Describe how entities interact or relate to each other<br>
- Consist of a source entity, target entity, and relation type<br>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Observations</strong><br>
- Discrete pieces of information about an entity<br>
- Stored as strings attached to specific entities<br>
- Should be atomic (one fact per observation)<br>
- Can be added or removed independently<br>
