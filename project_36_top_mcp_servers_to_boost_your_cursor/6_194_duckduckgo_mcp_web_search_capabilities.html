<p>The <a href="https://github.com/nickclyde/duckduckgo-mcp-server">DuckDuckGo MCP</a> enables Cursor to perform web searches using the DuckDuckGo search engine, giving it access to up-to-date information beyond its training data. This powerful server allows the AI to find recent documentation, solutions to coding problems, and current information to enhance its assistance, all while respecting user privacy. This stage will guide you through setting up and utilizing this MCP in your Cursor workflow.</p>

<alert>
There are a lot of MCPs that enable web search capabilities. We will use DuckDuckGo MCP because it's easy to set up and doesn't require an API key.
