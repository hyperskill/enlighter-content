<h5>Setup Instructions</h5>

<p>You can set up the Puppeteer MCP using either NPX or Docker. Choose the method that best suits your environment:</p>

<h5>NPX Setup</h5>
<callout type="chat">Create or edit a file .cursor/mcp.json to include the following MCP setup:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "puppeteer": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"
      ]
    }
  }
}</callout>

<h5>Docker Setup</h5>
<callout type="chat">Create or edit a file .cursor/mcp.json to include the following MCP setup:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "puppeteer": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "--init",
        "-e",
        "DOCKER_CONTAINER=true",
        "mcp/puppeteer"
