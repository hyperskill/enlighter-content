<h5>Setup Instructions</h5>

<p>You can set up the GitHub MCP using either NPX or Docker. Both methods require a GitHub Personal Access Token.</p>

<h5>NPX Setup</h5>
<callout type="chat">Create or edit a file .cursor/mcp.json to include the following MCP setup:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_github_personal_access_token"
      }
    }
  }
}</callout>

<h5>Docker Setup</h5>
<callout type="chat">Create or edit a file .cursor/mcp.json to include the following MCP setup:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_github_personal_access_token"
      }
    }
  }
}</callout>

<p>To create a GitHub Personal Access Token, go to <a href="https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new" target="_blank">GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens</a>. For full repository access, select the `repo` scope; for public repositories only, select the `public repositories` scope.</p>

<h5>Practical Example: Repository Search</h5>

<callout type="chat">Search for the most popular TypeScript state management libraries on GitHub. Look for repositories with over 1000 stars that have "state management" in their description or README.</callout>
