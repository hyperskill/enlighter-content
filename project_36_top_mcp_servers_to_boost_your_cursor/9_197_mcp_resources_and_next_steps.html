<p>Throughout this project, we've explored several powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that extend Cursor's capabilities. Let's recap what we've learned and explore resources for discovering more MCPs and even building your own.</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">What We've Learned</strong><br>

<p>In this project, we've covered several essential MCPs that enhance Cursor's functionality:</p>

- Sequential Thinking MCP: Structured problem-solving with step-by-step reasoning<br>
- Puppeteer MCP: Browser automation with Puppeteer's web interaction tools<br>
- GitHub MCP: Direct integration with GitHub repositories and workflows<br>
- Knowledge Graph Memory MCP: Persistent memory using a structured knowledge graph<br>
- DuckDuckGo MCP: Web search capabilities with content extraction<br>
- Compass MCP: Service discovery and recommendation for MCPs<br>
- Playwright MCP: Advanced browser automation and testing<br><br>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Finding More MCP Servers</strong><br>

<p>The ecosystem of MCP servers is constantly growing. Here are several resources to discover more MCP servers for your specific needs:</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Cursor Directory</strong><br>
<p><a href="https://cursor.directory">Cursor Directory</a> is a community platform for Cursor enthusiasts where you can explore a curated collection of MCP servers, along with rules, jobs, and more.</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Model Context Protocol GitHub Repository</strong><br>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers">collection of reference implementations for the Model Context Protocol</a>. This is an excellent resource for understanding implementation details, accessing the latest updates, and contributing to the ecosystem.</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">MCPServers.org</strong><br>
<p><a href="https://mcpservers.org">MCPServers.org</a> provides a comprehensive directory of MCP servers organized by category. This resource offers detailed descriptions and installation instructions for a wide range of different servers.</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">GitHub Search</strong><br>
<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/search?q=mcp&type=repositories">GitHub's search functionality</a> to find repositories tagged with "mcp" can help you discover community-created MCP servers and extensions.</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Building Your Own MCP Server</strong><br>

<p>Ready to take your skills to the next level?</p>

<p>Check out the comprehensive tutorial on building your own MCP servers: <a href="https://enlightby.ai/projects/11">Building Your Own MCP Server</a></p>
