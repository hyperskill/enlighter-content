<p>We have already reviewed Puppeteer web automation, and Playwright is a more modern and feature-rich alternative.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp">Playwright MCP</a> is a powerful server that brings Microsoft's Playwright browser automation capabilities to Cursor. This extensive toolkit enables precise control over web browsers, allowing for sophisticated web interactions, testing, and automation.</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Features:</strong><br>
- Comprehensive browser control with multiple interaction modes<br>
- Keyboard and mouse control for complex interactions<br>
- Screenshot capabilities with customization options<br>
- Tab and window management for multi-page workflows<br><br>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Key Use Cases</strong><br>
- Automated web testing and verification<br>
- Complex form filling and submission<br>
- Web scraping with precise element targeting<br>
- Multi-step workflow automation<br>
- Cross-browser compatibility testing<br><br>

<warning>Cursor can handle limited amount of tools slots. If you encounter a problem that new MCPs do not connect due to restrictions, turn off unnecessary ones to free up tools slots.</warning>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Setup Instructions</strong><br>

<p>You can set up the Playwright MCP using NPX, which is the recommended method:</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">NPX Setup</strong><br>
<callout type="chat">Create or edit a file .cursor/mcp.json to include the following MCP setup:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}</callout>

<p>For headless browser operation (no visible browser window), use:</p>

<callout type="chat">Create or edit a file .cursor/mcp.json to include the following MCP setup:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--headless"
      ]
    }
  }
}
</callout>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Interaction Modes</strong><br>

<p>Playwright MCP offers two primary interaction modes:</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">1. Snapshot Mode (Default)</strong><br>
- Uses accessibility snapshots for better performance<br>
- More reliable for structured content<br>
- Preferred for most automation tasks<br>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">2. Vision Mode</strong><br>
- Uses screenshots for visual-based interactions<br>
- Better for visually complex interfaces<br>
- Enable with the --vision flag:<br>

<callout type="chat">Create or edit a file .cursor/mcp.json to include the following MCP setup:
    
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--vision"
      ]
    }
  }
}
