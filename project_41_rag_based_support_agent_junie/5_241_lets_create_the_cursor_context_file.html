<p>Junie knows how to create files and a whole application. Let's start small, ask it to create a file in the root of your project that describes in detail how the application works. We have prepared this file for you, you will need to edit it a bit in the future.</p>

<callout label="Execute prompt in code mode of Junie" type="chat">
