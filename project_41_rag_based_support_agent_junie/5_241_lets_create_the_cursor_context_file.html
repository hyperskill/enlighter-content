<p>Junie knows how to create files and a whole application. Let's start small, ask it to create a file in the root of your project that describes in detail how the application works. We have prepared this file for you, you will need to edit it a bit in the future.</p>

<callout label="Execute prompt using Code mode in Junie" type="composer">
Create a file named task-description.md in the project folder. Add the following content to it:

## CREDENTIALS AND CONSTANTS

ZENDESK API URL: 
ZENDESK API KEY: 
OPENROUTER API KEY: 
OPENROUTER API HOST:
LLM MODEL:
EMBEDDINGS MODEL: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 from Huggingface

## APP REQUIREMENTS

1. Download resolved ticket descriptions from Zendesk API
2. Build database for RAG. Database must have two columns: question and answer. Extract questions and answers based on a conversation - every ticket has a list of comments.
3. Answers are made by user with id=111
4. Build a RAG with Langchain based on answered ticket comments
5. Download open tickets from Zendesk API
6. Recommend answers to open tickets based on RAG. Ensure system prompt includes both question and answer.
7. Send recommended answers as non-public comments to related tickets in Zendesk API
8. Get updated tickets from Zendesk API and print to the console
9. Do not fix exact versions of python packages. Let pip resolve it by itself
10. Use embeddings from langchain-huggingface
11. Test the solution BY YOURSELF by running the app in console:
    11.1 The app receives question as input and shows ONLY an answer
    11.2 RAG built properly: system prompt includes question(s) and answer(s)
    11.3 RAG built properly: an answer based on included question(s) and answer(s)
12. Fix all errors
13. Never change credentials
