<p>We've already added all the requirements to the <code>task-description.md</code> file. Here's the description prompt:</p>

<pre>
<code>1. Download resolved ticket descriptions from Zendesk API
2. Build database for RAG. Database must have two columns: question and answer. Extract questions and answers based on a conversation - every ticket has a list of comments.
3. Answers are made by user with id=111
4. Build a RAG with Langchain based on answered ticket comments
5. Download open tickets from Zendesk API
6. Recommend answers to open tickets based on RAG. Ensure system prompt includes both question and answer.
7. Send recommended answers as non-public comments to related tickets in Zendesk API
8. Get updated tickets from Zendesk API and print to the console
9. Do not fix exact versions of python packages. Let pip resolve it by itself
10. Use embeddings from langchain-huggingface
11. Test the solution BY YOURSELF by running the app in console:
    11.1. The app receives question as input and shows ONLY an answer
    11.2. RAG built properly: system prompt includes question(s) and answer(s)
    11.3. RAG built properly: an answer based on included question(s) and answer(s)
12. Fix all errors
13. Never change credentials</code>
