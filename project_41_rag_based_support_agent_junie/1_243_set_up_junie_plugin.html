<h5>What is Junie</h5>

<p>
Junie is part of the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/ai/" target="_blank">JetBrains AI suite</a>. While the basic AI Assistant can already generate text or code snippets, Junie takes it up a notch by using project context. That means she's not just smart—she's aware of what you're working on.
</p>

<p>With Junie, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delegate. Iterate. Review</strong> – Assign tasks to Junie, and it will handle them autonomously. Junie will save you time and effort that you can use to drive results and creative solutions instead.</li>
<li><strong>Stay in control of your code</strong> – Share prompts in the chat with Junie, review the results, and accept or iterate as needed. Adjust, experiment, and create with better focus and fewer distractions.</li>
<li><strong>Keep the project consistent</strong> – Junie learns the context of your code, understanding your preferences and style. Refining its approach with each iteration, Junie helps you write cleaner, more consistent code.</li>
</ul>

<alert>Junie currently supports JetBrains IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, and others.</alert>

<h5>Installing</h5>
<p>Installing Junie is straightforward, and you only need a few clicks:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings / Preferences</strong> → Plugins.</li>
<li>Search for <strong>Junie</strong> and click <strong>Install</strong>.</li>
<li>Restart the IDE when prompted.</li>
</ol>
