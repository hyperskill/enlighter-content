<p>That was awesome! Here are a few key takeaways we believe are important to highlight from this app.</p>

<ol>
<li>Junie can help build applications as well as understand technical terms and issues.</li>
<li>For application generation, it's crucial to accurately describe the context that the AI will use when generating code.</li>
<li>Ideally, the context should include your system's characteristics, all keys and access details, and descriptions of the recommended LLM models for generating the application.</li>
<li>Junie generates applications more effectively when the context includes the documentation needed for the application to function properly.</li>
<li>The most important part of creating an application with an AI Agents is the prompt that describes the desired functionality and application requirements. Writing effective prompts often requires some technical background. In many cases, the prompt needs to be improved step by step by observing the difficulties the AI encounters during code generation and debugging.</li>
<li>Writing effective prompts requires some technical expertise, but you can develop this skill by studying examples like ours. If you come across any unclear terms, just ask Junie.</li>
<li>A generated application can be improved incrementally by adding new requirements. You can also build the application step by step, module by module.</li>
<li>Creating applications with AI agents is still software engineering â€“ but now with the superpower of an LLM as your assistant.</li>
