<p>Let's improve the app by adding a feature that lets you type a random question and get an answer using RAG – right from the console. Try running this command in the chat to see what happens.</p>

<callout label="Execute prompt in code mode of Junie" type="chat">
I want to test my application. Please give me an ability to enter my own question from the console and receive an answer.
</callout>

<p>Once Junie is finished, ask your RAG how to reset your password – it should provide the correct instructions.</p>
