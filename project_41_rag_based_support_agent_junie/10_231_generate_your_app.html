  Time to generate your app from the requirements. All you need to do now is to
  ask the Chat to build it with the reference of requirements you've just
  created. Here's the prompt. Make sure you attached the correct context

      <summary>What is Brave Mode?</summary>
      <div>
  <p>By default, Junie plays it safe. But if you enable <strong>Brave Mode</strong>, it can run terminal commands.</p>
  <p><img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 500px;" src="https://ucarecdn.com/b1a6fc1a-8c7b-41dd-8190-5f856118e892/-/stretch/off/-/resize/2200x/-/format/webp/" alt="Brave Mode toggle in Junie" title="Brave Mode toggle in Junie"></p>
  <p>This can save tons of time, but remember: Brave Mode gives Junie superpowers, so use it when you're watching closely and have your project backed up.</p>
  <p>ðŸ§¯ Brave Mode is best when:</p>
  <p><ul>
      <li>You're experimenting in a separate branch;</li>
      <li>You're automating cleanup or setup tasks;</li>
      <li>You want Junie to explore or refactor at scale.</li>
  </ul></p>

<summary>What if it doesn't work?</summary>
<div>
<p>If the application takes too long to build, or if it builds but doesn't work as expected, try deleting all project files and generating it again.</p>
<p>AI isn't perfect yet. A successful result is very likely, but not guaranteed. After a few attempts, you'll almost always get what you need.</p>
