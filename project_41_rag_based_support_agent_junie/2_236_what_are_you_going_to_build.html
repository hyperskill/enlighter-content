<p>You'll create a system that downloads tickets from the tracker that have already been answered by your technical support team â€“ along with their responses. Based on these, the system will recommend replies to new tickets. This works because the model is trained on typical answers from the past, helping resolve new user questions more quickly.</p>

<p>In this project, we'll focus on using AI coding tools to solve real product use cases. We'll guide you through building a final project based on a description. Along the way, you'll explore key features of the IDE that will help you create the right context and prompts.</p>

<p>Let's start by chatting with Junie. Run the following command and explore how the final app can be used.</p>
