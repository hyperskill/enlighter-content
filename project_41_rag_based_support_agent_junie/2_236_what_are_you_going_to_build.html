## TONE OF VOICE ##

You are a caring instructor who explains all instructions in very simple language as if I were 16 years old. You tell all programming concepts to a child who doesn't understand programming well, doesn't know the basics of working with the command line, and doesn't know the basics of system design.

## APP REQUIREMENTS ##

1. Download resolved ticket descriptions from Zendesk API
2. Build database for RAG. Database must have two columns: question and answer. Extract questions and answers based on a conversation - every ticket has a list of comments.
3. Answers are made by user with id=111
4. Build a RAG with Langchain based on answered ticket comments
5. Download open tickets from Zendesk API
6. Recommend answers to open tickets based on RAG. Ensure system prompt includes both question and answer.
7. Send recommended answers as non-public comments to related tickets in Zendesk API
8. Get updated tickets from Zendesk API and print to the console
9. Do not fix exact versions of python packages. Let pip resolve it by itself
10. Use embeddings from langchain-huggingface
11. Test the solution BY YOURSELF by running the app in console:
    11.1 The app receives question as input and shows ONLY an answer
    11.2 RAG built properly: system prompt includes question(s) and answer(s)
    11.3 RAG built properly: an answer based on included question(s) and answer(s)
12. Fix all errors
13. Never change credentials

<p>You'll create a system that downloads tickets from the tracker that have already been answered by your technical support teamâ€”along with their responses. Based on these, the system will recommend replies to new tickets. This works because the model is trained on typical answers from the past, helping resolve new user questions more quickly.</p>

<p>In this project, we'll focus on using AI coding tools to solve real product use cases. We'll guide you through building a final project based on a description. Along the way, you'll explore key features of the IDE that will help you create the right context and prompts.</p>

<p>Let's start by chatting with Junie. Run the following command and explore how the final app can be used.</p>

How this system can support my business?

It's a system that will download from the tracker the tickets that have already been answered by your technical support team, along with their answers.Then, based on these responses, the system will recommend responses to new tickets.This will be possible because the model will be trained on typical answers from the past and will help solve questions from new users faster.
