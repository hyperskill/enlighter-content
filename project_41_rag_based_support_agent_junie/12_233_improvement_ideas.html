<p>Great job! Your app should be working now – congratulations!</p> 
<p>Here's some advice to help you improve it and practice your AI coding skills.</p>

<p>We're using a hardcoded user ID in our prompt. We know that our support agent has <code>ID 111</code>, but this isn't a scalable solution. Try improving your app by retrieving all support agent IDs from the API and updating the code accordingly. It might be challenging, but don't give up — exploring AI tools can be tough at first, but it's a crucial skill for the future of product development.</p>

<p>Try to improve your app on your own. Replace the hardcoded ID with the new one your app can get from the API.</p>
