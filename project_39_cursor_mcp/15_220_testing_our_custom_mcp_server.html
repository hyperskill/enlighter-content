<p>Now that we've built our Echo MCP server, let's configure Claude Desktop to use it and test its functionality. In this stage, we'll add our server to the MCP configuration, verify it's enabled in settings, and test each of its features.</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Adding the Echo Server to MCP Configuration</strong><br>

<p>First, we need to add our custom MCP server to Claude's claude_desktop_config.json file. The same as before, we need to add the server to the claude_desktop_config.json file.</p>

<pre>
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Echo": {
      "command": "path/to/your/project/venv/bin/python3.12",
      "args": [
        "path/to/your/project/echo_server.py",
      ]
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<alert>
  Don't forget to update the path to the python executable and the path to the echo_server.py file.

<p>Next, restart Claude Desktop and click on the hammer icon to check if the server is enabled as explained in the previous steps.</p>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Testing the Echo Tool</strong><br>

<p>Now, let's test the tool functionality:</p>

<callout type="chat">Please use the echo_tool and show the result.</callout>
<checkable-item title="Echo tool is called by AI"></checkable-item>
<checkable-item title="Echo tool response has format 'Tool echo: {message}'"></checkable-item>

<strong style="font-size: 15px;">What's Next?</strong><br>

<p>Now that we've successfully tested our custom Echo MCP server, in the next stage we'll explore advanced testing and debugging techniques provided by MCP SDK.</p>
