<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>You implemented four essential agentic patterns with Google ADK. These patterns combine to improve correctness, latency, cost, governance, and user trust.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Router</strong>: Route requests to the right specialist for capability focus and modularity.</li>
  <li><strong>Planner → Executor</strong>: Separate high-quality planning from cost-efficient execution.</li>
  <li><strong>Self-critique</strong>: Iterate with a critic/refiner loop for measurable quality gains.</li>
  <li><strong>HITL</strong>: Require human sign-off for high-risk actions via long-running tools.</li>
</ul>

<h5>What to try next</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Create evaluation sets and run ADK CLI evals to measure quality and regressions.</li>
  <li>Adopt tracing and logging to understand routing, planning, and critique decisions.</li>
  <li>Containerize and deploy your agents with Cloud Run or Vertex AI Agent Engine.</li>
</ul>

<callout label="Ask Cascade: next steps">
Suggest two production hardening steps for my agent system (observability, evaluation, safety, or deployment) and show the concrete ADK features or commands I should use to implement them.

<p>Congratulations on completing this project. Keep iterating—patterns are most powerful when adapted to your domain and constraints.</p>
