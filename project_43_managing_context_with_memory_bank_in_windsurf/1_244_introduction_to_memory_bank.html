<p>Today we'll learn about Memory Bank - a powerful approach to maintaining context with AI powered IDEs like Windsurf and its AI Agent - Cascade.</p>

<h5>What You'll Learn</h5>

<ul>
<li>How to set up a Memory Bank for your projects</li>
<li>The structure and purpose of each core file</li>
<li>How to maintain and update your Memory Bank</li>
<li>How to build a real project using Memory Bank</li>
</ul>

<h5>What is Memory Bank?</h5>

<p>Memory Bank is a structured documentation system that helps Cascade maintain context across sessions. It transforms Cascade from a stateless assistant into a persistent development partner that can effectively "remember" your project details over time.</p>

<p>When working with AI coding, you've likely encountered this common limitation: the AI has no memory of your previous conversations once you start a new session. This means:</p>

<ul>
<li>You need to re-explain your project repeatedly</li>
<li>The AI can't recall decisions you made together</li>
<li>You lose continuity in complex projects</li>
<li>Each session starts from scratch</li>
</ul>

<h5>How Memory Bank Solves This Problem</h5>

<p>Memory Bank addresses this limitation through a systematic approach to documentation that complements Cascade's native Memories system:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Structured Documentation</strong>: A hierarchy of markdown files that build a complete picture of your project.</li>
<li><strong>Context Preservation</strong>: Key information is stored in a format that's easy for both you and Cascade to reference.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Updates</strong>: Documentation evolves as your project progresses.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Memory Bank is Not Magic</h5>

<p>It's important to understand that Memory Bank isn't a magical feature that gives AI Agent perfect memory. It's a methodical approach to documentation that you maintain to enhance the AI's understanding. 
Cascade already has powerful features like code indexing and its "Memories" system to retain context.
Our Memory Bank structure will supercharge these capabilities.</p>

<h5>Setting Up Memory Bank</h5>

<p>
    To set up Memory Bank we will use <a href="https://github.com/ipospelov/mcp-memory-bank">Memory Bank MCP Server</a>. 
    It's a simple way to create a Memory Bank for your projects automatically based on provided context.
</p>

<p>First of all, we need to install uv and uvx tools to run Memory Bank MCP Server.</p>

<callout label="Ask Cascade to install uv and uvx tool">
    Install uv and uvx tool if it's not installed yet
</callout>

<p>Then, we need to configure Memory Bank MCP Server.</p>

<p>Open Windsurf settings:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For Mac: Windsurf → Settings → Windsurf Settings or <code>CMD⌘ + ,</code></li>
    <li>For Windows: Settings → Windsurf Settings or <code>CTRL + ,</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Then open <code>Cascade</code> tab and press the <code>manage plugins</code> button. You should see the following screen:</p>

<p>Now press <code>View raw config</code> button and add Memory Bank MCP to the list of MCP servers:</p>

<callout label="Copy Memory Bank MCP Server config and paste it into the mcp_config.json file">
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "mcp-memory-bank": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "--from",
                "git+https://github.com/ipospelov/mcp-memory-bank",
                "mcp_memory_bank"
            ]
        }
    }
}
</callout>

<p>Alternatively, you can use Docker to run Memory Bank MCP Server.</p>

        <summary>Setup with Docker</summary>
        <callout label="Copy Memory Bank MCP Server config and paste it into the mcp_config.json file">
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "memory-bank": {
            "command": "docker",
            "args": [
                "run",
                "-i",
                "--rm",
                "19283744/mcp-memory-bank:latest"
            ]
            }
        }
    }
        </callout>
    </details>
</alert>

<p>After that, you should see the Memory Bank MCP Server in the list of your plugins with the following tools:</p>

<p><img style="margin: auto; display: block;" src="https://ucarecdn.com/8c5ddbd2-bb5d-4593-8388-3114a719ee43/" alt="Windsurf MCP enabled" title="Windsurf MCP enabled"></p>

<h5>What's next?</h5>

<p>Outcome of this stage:</p>
