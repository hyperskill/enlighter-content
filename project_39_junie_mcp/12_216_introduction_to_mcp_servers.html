<p>In this stage, we'll learn the basics of MCP servers and set up our first server using Playwright in Junie.</p>

<h5>What is MCP?</h5>

<p>MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that allows AI models to interact with external tools and services. With MCP servers, the AI can perform actions beyond just generating text, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Controlling applications</li>
<li>Accessing external APIs and data sources</li>
<li>Running specific commands on your system</li>
<li>Browsing websites and taking screenshots</li>
</ul>


<h5>MCP Configuration Format</h5>

<p>The configuration format for MCP servers follows this structure:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "mcpServers": {
    "serverName": {
      "command": "executable", // or "url"
      "args": ["arg1", "arg2"],
      "env": { "ENV_VAR": "value" },
      "transport": "stdio" // or "sse"
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>serverName</code>: The name you'll use to reference this server</li>
  <li><code>command</code>: The executable to run</li>
  <li><code>args</code>: Command-line arguments to pass</li>
  <li><code>env</code>: Environment variables (optional)</li>
  <li><code>transport</code>: Communication method (default is "stdio")</li>
</ul>

<alert>Do not worry if you don't understand all of this parameters right now. We'll go through an examples in the next steps to sort this out.</alert>

<h5>Setting Up Playwright MCP Server</h5>

<p>Let's set up our first MCP server using Playwright. Playwright is a browser automation framework that will allow the AI to control web browsers, navigate to websites, take screenshots, and interact with web pages.</p>

<alert>
  Before continuing, ensure you have npx installed on your system. 
  npx is a package runner that comes with Node.js and npm. 
  This is required for the Playwright MCP server to work. 
  Let's ask Junie to install npx if it's not installed:
  <callout label="Execute prompt using Code mode in Junie" type="composer">Check if npx and npm are installed. Install them if they are not installed.</callout>
</alert>

<p>Let's create the Playwright MCP configuration:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open <code>Settings â†’ MCP Settings</code> in Junie.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>+</strong> button and paste the following configuration:</li>
</ol>

<p><img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 800px;" src="https://ucarecdn.com/e65c3764-51c5-4e21-b3b6-c28824a7b916/" alt="Opening Junie settings" title="Opening Junie settings"></p>

<pre><code>
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "playwright": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "@playwright/mcp@latest"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using Junie on Windows, you may need to use PowerShell instead of npx, and modify the configuration as follows:</p>

<pre><code>
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "playwright": {
        "command": "cmd",
        "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"]
      }
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>After a few seconds the MCP server will be ready to use - you'll see a green toggle button in the MCP servers list.</p>

<checkable-item title="Playwright MCP server is ready to use"></checkable-item>

<p>You can see the list of available tools in the settings if you click over the status icon:</p>

<h5>Testing Our Playwright Setup</h5>

<p>Now that we've set up our Playwright MCP server, let's test it by asking the AI to use it to check the weather in New York.</p>

<checkable-item title="Execute following prompt in <strong>Junie</strong>">
</checkable-item>
<pre><code>Using the playwright MCP tools, check the current temperature in New York City.</code></pre>

<p><img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 800px;" src="https://ucarecdn.com/0ad52025-4836-4ba6-910b-976a71c37c8c/" alt="Junie MCP Tools" title="Junie MCP Tools"></p>

<p>If everything is set up correctly, the AI should be able to use the Playwright tools to open a browser, navigate to a website and answer the question.</p>

<alert>Browsing with Playwright is not so fast. Give it a time to do the task.</alert>

<h5>What's Next?</h5>

<p>In the next stage, we'll dive deeper into MCP architecture, transport formats, and will build a custom MCP server.</p>
