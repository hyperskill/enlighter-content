<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>Welcome to the tutorial on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol where we will get a glimpse into the future of Agentic AI. The world of AI development today is like a global company that has just hired thousands of brilliant, highly-specialized professionals. Thanks to powerful frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI, Microsoft's AutoGen and many others we can create these specialized AI agents with unprecedented ease. They can automate business workflows, generate creative content, and perform a vast array of other tasks.</p>
<p>However, this hiring spree has created a major communication challenge. These brilliant experts have been gathered in a room to solve problems, but they all speak different languages. An agent built with one framework cannot easily share information with an agent built on another. This lack of a common language creates significant friction, limits the scope of what we can achieve, and is the central problem we will learn to solve.</p>

<h5>Our Tutorial Roadmap</h5>

<p>This tutorial is a complete journey. We won't just talk about theory; we will guide you from the foundational concepts of inter-agent communication all the way to deploying your own functional, collaborative AI agents. By the end of this series, you will have the practical skills to participate in this new, interconnected AI ecosystem.</p>

<p>Here’s a look at what we will build together:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The Collaborative Future</strong><br>We start by understanding the core problem of agent isolation and introduce the A2A protocol as the solution.</li>
    <li><strong>Under the Hood of A2A</strong><br>We'll take a deep dive into the technical building blocks of the protocol, such as Agent Cards, Skills, and Tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Building First Agent's Skill and Card</strong><br>This is where we get hands-on. We'll write the code for our "Creative Collab" agents—a Lyricist and a Composer.</li>
    <li><strong>Deployment and Discovery</strong><br>We'll learn how to launch our agents online, making them discoverable and ready to collaborate with others.</li>
    <li><strong>The Road Ahead</strong><br>Finally, we will summarize what we've built and discuss the future possibilities that A2A unlocks for developers.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Setting Up Prerequisites</h5>

<p>Let's prepare our development environment. This tutorial requires Python. The main SDK we will use is <a href="https://a2aproject.github.io/A2A/latest/sdk/python/" target="_blank">a2a-sdk</a> and <a href="https://google.github.io/adk-docs/" target="_blank">google-adk</a>.</p>

<p>Ask your coding agent to perform the following steps, or you can do it manually using the terminal inside your IDE.</p>

<callout label="Prepare development environment">
1. Create a requirements.txt file with the following packages: a2a-sdk, google-adk, uvicorn, python-dotenv
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install the requirements.txt dependencies
4. Create a main.py file
</callout>

<checkable-item title="The a2a-sdk and google-adk libraries are installed."></checkable-item>

<p>The objective of this lesson was to provide a clear understanding of the challenges posed by agent isolation and to introduce the A2A protocol as the key to a collaborative AI future.</p>

<checkable-item title="The current state of AI agents and the challenges they face are understood."></checkable-item>

<p>In the next lesson, we will take a closer at the A2A protocol to understand the problem it solves.</p>
