<h5>Time to Get Hands-On</h5>
<p>Now that Claude Code is installed and authenticated, it's time to experience its power firsthand. In this stage, we'll create a basic task manager application structure and see how Claude Code can intelligently generate code, suggest architecture, and set up development environments.</p>

<p>This hands-on practice will demonstrate the Claude Code in action - we'll provide the requirements, and Claude Code will make smart decisions about implementation details.</p>

<h5>Setting Up Your Project</h5>
<p>Let's start by creating a dedicated workspace for our task manager application. We'll set up the basic project structure manually first, then let Claude Code enhance it with intelligent suggestions.</p>

<h5>Step 1: Create Project Structure</h5>

<p>Let's set up the basic project structure with npm and create our initial files:</p>

<callout>
npm init -y
mkdir src
cd src
touch index.html app.js style.css
cd ..</callout>

<p>This creates a basic structure with a `package.json` file and our main source files in the `src` directory.</p>

<h5>Step 2: Generate Your Application Structure</h5>
<p>Now comes the exciting part - let's start Claude Code and see how it can help us build our application:</p>

<p>Here's where the magic happens. We'll give Claude Code a clear prompt about what we want to build, and it will make intelligent decisions about the implementation:</p>

<callout label="Copy and paste to Claude Code">
I'm creating a simple Task Manager web application. Help me set up the basic project structure with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Create a package.json file with necessary development scripts, including live-server for local hosting.

The task manager should include:
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks by status (all, active, completed)
- Clean, modern interface

Please set up the complete file structure and provide the initial code for all files.

Run the app after generating all the files
</callout>

<h5>What to Expect</h5>
<p>After running this prompt, Claude Code will demonstrate several key capabilities of semi-deterministic workflows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Intelligent Architecture Decisions:</strong> Claude will suggest an appropriate file structure and code organization</li>
<li><strong>Development Environment Setup:</strong> It will configure package.json with useful scripts for development</li>
<li><strong>Modern Web Practices:</strong> The generated code will follow current best practices for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
<li><strong>Complete Implementation:</strong> You'll get working code that you can immediately test and run</li>
</ul>

<h5>Verification Steps</h5>
<p>Once Claude Code finishes generating your application, let's verify everything is working correctly:</p>

<callout>
Check the project structure. Verify that there are:

- Updated package.json with development scripts
- HTML file with proper structure
- CSS file with modern styling
- JavaScript file with task management functionality</callout>

<p>Now let's run and test the application.</p>

<callout>Install dependencies and test your application:

npm install
npm start
</callout>

<p>By the end of this stage, you should have:</p>

<ul interactive>
  <li title="A complete project structure with all necessary files"></li>
  <li title="A working task manager application that runs in your browser"></li>
</ul>

<alert>If your application isn't working as expected, don't worry! In the next stage, we'll explore how to iterate and improve the application using Claude Code's debugging and enhancement capabilities.</alert>

<h5>What's Next</h5>
<p>Congratulations! You've successfully used Claude Code to generate a complete web application. In the next stage, we'll dive deeper into the semi-deterministic workflow by customizing and enhancing the application, demonstrating how Claude Code can adapt to changing requirements while maintaining code quality.</p>
