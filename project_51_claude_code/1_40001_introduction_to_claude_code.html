<h5>Welcome to Semi-Deterministic Workflows with Claude Code!</h5>
<p>In this course, you'll learn how to harness the power of AI to streamline your development process. We'll be using Claude Code, a cutting-edge tool from Anthropic that integrates the advanced reasoning of the Claude 3 model family directly into your command line.</p>

<h5>What is Claude Code?</h5>
<p>Claude Code is a command-line interface (CLI) that acts as your AI coding partner. It can help you with a wide range of development tasks, from generating boilerplate code and writing unit tests to debugging complex issues and designing application architecture. By bringing AI into your terminal, Claude Code helps you code faster, smarter, and with greater consistency.</p>

<h5>What are you going to learn?</h5>
<p>You will learn about a powerful software development approach called semi-deterministic workflow. This method combines the consistency of automated scripts with the creative problem-solving of large language models. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to build robust applications more efficiently by letting the AI handle the heavy lifting while you guide the overall strategy.</p>

<h5>What You Will Build</h5>
<p>In this course, you will create a simple task manager application using Claude Code and a semi-deterministic workflow approach. This workflow combines the predictability of automated processes with the intelligence of AI-driven decision making.</p>

<p>The task manager will feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add, edit, and delete tasks</li>
<li>Mark tasks as complete</li>
<li>Filter tasks by status</li>
<li>Clean, modern interface</li>
</ul>

<p>But more importantly, you'll learn how to set up workflows where Claude Code handles architectural decisions while maintaining consistent coding standards.</p>

<h5>Understanding Semi-Deterministic Workflows</h5>
<p>Semi-deterministic workflows represent a powerful approach to software development that combines the best of both worlds:</p>

<p><strong>Deterministic part:</strong> Pre-configured rules and automatic actions such as code formatting, testing, commits, and consistent project structure. These elements remain predictable and standardized.</p>

<p><strong>Semi-deterministic part:</strong> Claude makes intelligent decisions about code structure, architecture, feature implementation, and improvements based on the current context and project needs.</p>

<p>This approach allows you to maintain coding standards while leveraging AI's creativity and problem-solving capabilities for complex development decisions.</p>

<h5>What's Next</h5>
<p>Now that you have an understanding of Claude Code and semi-deterministic workflows, it's time to set up your environment. In the next stage, we'll install and configure Claude Code to get you ready for building our task manager application.</p>
