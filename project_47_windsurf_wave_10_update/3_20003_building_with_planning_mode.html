<p>With our strategic plan established in the <code>plan.md</code> file, we can now begin the development phase. In this lesson, we will execute the initial tasks from our plan: creating the project's file structure and building the basic HTML layout for our "Smart Task Manager." We will also introduce the Windsurf Browser to see our application come to life with a live preview.</p>
<h5>Executing the Plan</h5>
<p>A key advantage of Planning Mode is that even when you start a new conversation with Cascade, it will know the current state and plan of the project and will continue from there.</p>
<p>Let's instruct Cascade to perform the first step from our checklist.</p>
<callout label="Ask Cascade to create the project files">
Build the app based on our `plan.md` file.
</callout>
<p>Cascade will now create the necessary files and folders for the project and write the code to the files. Usually, Cascade will automatically update the <code>plan.md</code> file to reflect the progress, or you can ask it to do it in case it is not updated.</p>

<p>Now let's see the result of our work, and the best way to do it is to use the new integrated browser.</p>
<h5>Windsurf Browser</h5>
<p>A significant feature introduced in Windsurf Wave 10 is the integrated Windsurf Browser - it's a fully functional, Chromium-based web browser embedded directly within the Windsurf interface. Its primary purpose is to bridge the context gap between the developer and the AI assistant, Cascade.</p>
<p>Traditionally, an AI coding assistant is "blind" to anything outside of the code files it can read. It doesn't know what your running application looks like, what errors are appearing in the browser console, or what documentation you are currently reading. This forces the developer to act as a bridge, constantly describing visual issues or copy-pasting information.</p>
<p>The Windsurf Browser solves this by giving Cascade direct access to the content of open browser tabs. This shared context allows for a more fluid and efficient collaboration, making the AI a more active partner in the entire development lifecycle, especially for front-end tasks.</p>
<h5>Live Preview with the Windsurf Browser</h5>
<p>Usually, after Cascade finishes writing the code, it will ask you to open the browser to see the result. But you can also open the browser manually by clicking the "Open Browser" button in the top right corner of the Windsurf.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the app running in the Windsurf Browser. However, due to the non-deterministic nature of LLMs, your result might be slightly different.</p>

<p>Now that our application has a visible foundation, we can move on to styling and improving the app. In the next lesson, we will focus specifically on the browser's context-aware <strong>toolbar</strong>, exploring the powerful tools that help the AI "see" your application and assist with these tasks.</p>
