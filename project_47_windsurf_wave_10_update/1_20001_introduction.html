<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>AI-powered development environments like Windsurf are evolving rapidly, introducing new features designed to enhance developer productivity. The primary goal of these advancements is to improve the contextual understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to generate more accurate and reliable code. This tutorial will explore some of these new capabilities.</p>

<h5>The Windsurf Wave 10 Update</h5>

<p>This tutorial focuses on the Wave 10 update for Windsurf, which introduces two significant features aimed at improving the developer's interaction with the AI assistant, Cascade. These features are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Planning Mode:</strong> A tool designed to help manage long-term project goals and complex, multi-step tasks by maintaining a shared project plan.</li>
    <li><strong>The Windsurf Browser:</strong> An integrated, Chromium-based browser that provides the AI with direct visual and technical context of a web application's front end.</li>
</ul>

<h5>What You'll Learn</h5>

<p>By following this tutorial, you will gain practical knowledge on how to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Set up and use Planning Mode to create a structured project roadmap with an AI assistant.</li>
    <li>Utilize the integrated Windsurf Browser for live application previews and context-aware front-end development.</li>
    <li>Apply an effective workflow that combines both features to build a web application from an initial concept to a functional product.</li>
    <li>Communicate with the AI more efficiently for tasks like styling, feature implementation, and debugging.</li>
</ul>

<h5>About the Learning Project</h5>

<p>To demonstrate these features in a practical setting, we will build a "Smart Task Manager" web application. This project was chosen because its development cycle naturally showcases the benefits of the new tools. We will use standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript) to keep the focus on the IDE's workflow rather than on a complex framework.</p>

<p>You will learn how to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Use <strong>Planning Mode</strong> to outline the application's core features and structure at the beginning of the project.</li>
    <li>Refer to this plan throughout development to guide the AI in generating code step-by-step.</li>
    <li>Use the <strong>Windsurf Browser</strong> to render the application, provide visual context to the AI for styling, and debug front-end issues directly within the IDE.</li>
</ol>
<p>This hands-on approach will help you understand how to integrate these features into your own development practices.</p>

<h5>Getting Ready</h5>

<p>To complete this tutorial, you will need Windsurf IDE version 1.10.0 (Wave 10) or later installed on your system. No other project files or specific configurations are required, as we will be building everything from scratch.</p>

<p>To check your version of Windsurf IDE, navigate to <strong>Windsurf > About Windsurf</strong> from the menu bar. If your version is older, please update it before proceeding.</p>

<h5>Outcome of This Lesson and Next Steps</h5>

<p>The objective of this lesson was to provide a clear understanding of the new features in Wave 10 and the goals of this tutorial. With the setup complete, we are ready to begin our project.</p>

<p>In the next stage, we will take a deep dive into <strong>Planning Mode</strong>. You will learn how to activate it and generate the initial strategic plan for our "Smart Task Manager" application.</p>
