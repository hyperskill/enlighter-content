<p>You are ready to generate the application.</p>
<p>First, let's check:</p>
<ol interactive>
<li title="Brave Mode enabled"></li>
<li title="Junie is in Code mode"></li>
</ol>

<template name="junie_brave_mode"/>

<p>If yes, it is enough to run this prompt:</p>

<callout label="Execute prompt using Code mode in Junie" type="composer">
Generate a browser app that accesses my camera and gives me the ability to select Instagram-like filters to my video stream on the fly. Use HTML, CSS and JS only. Don't use any UI library.
</callout>

<p>Junie will create a plan and then start generating the application.</p>

<summary>What if it doesn't work?</summary>
<div>
<p>If the application takes too long to build, or if it builds but doesn't work as expected, try deleting all project files and generating it again.</p>
<p>AI isn't perfect yet. A successful result is very likely, but not guaranteed. After a few attempts, you'll almost always get what you need.</p>
