<p>Once the plugin is active, Junie becomes available through the IDE.</p>

<p>So first, we recommend that you turn on YOLO mode in the cursor settings. You can find this option in Preferences, then Cursor Settings, then Features.</p>

<p>Set your Chat to Agent mode</p>
<p><checkable-item title="Call the chat panel with <code>Cmd + Shift + L</code> → set <code>agent</code> mode">

<p>These requirements will help the LLM to perform autogeneration and auto-fixing of your application with minimal user intervention. Sometimes you will be asked to run shell commands, but in most cases the cursor will do everything by itself. Chat will also see any errors that occur and try to fix them on the fly.</p>
<warning>If you are unable to activate agent mode in an empty project, that's okay. Just make sure that agent mode is enabled before generating your application. Cursor tries to detect the type of your request automatically and does not always activate the right switch.</warning>
