<p>Your application is created and running. We hope you are enjoying the result.</p>
<p>Junie can not only create applications from scratch, but also improve existing ones step by step. For example, try adding some more filter to your simple application. Here are a couple of examples from us to awaken your imagination. Feel free to come up with your own filters and experiment when you try our options.</p>

<checkable-item title="Try those commands in Chat:">
<callout type="chat">Add a filter that pixelizes my video, add a range input to control pixel size.</callout>
<callout type="chat">Add a filter that converts webcam video to a halftone look where the dot size is based on the darkness in that area of the image.</callout>

<p>Sometimes LLM generates something not quite right. In this case just discuss the problem you are experiencing with Junie and ask her to fix the problem.</p>
<p>Here's an example we've encountered:</p>
<callout type="chat">Some of the filter buttons on my page are inactive, please check the code and make it so that I can use all the filters in my browser.</callout>
