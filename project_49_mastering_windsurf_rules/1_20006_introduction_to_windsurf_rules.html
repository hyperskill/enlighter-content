<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>Welcome to Mastering Windsurf Rules course! If you've ever wished your AI pair programmer knew your project's specific coding style, or remembered your personal guidelines from one session to the next, you're in the right place. This tutorial will teach you how to transform the powerful Cascade Agent into a personalized assistant tailored perfectly to your codebase and workflows.</p>

<h5>The Problem: Generic AI vs. Specific Projects</h5>

<p>AI coding assistants are incredibly powerful, but out of the box, they lack project-specific context. They don't know you prefer Tabs over Spaces, use Python over JavaScript, or follow a strict naming conventions. Constantly reminding the AI of these basics is repetitive and inefficient. Windsurf Rules are designed to solve this problem.</p>

<p>Rules are persistent, user-defined instructions that guide the Cascade Agent. By setting up rules, you provide a permanent source of truth for your project's standards, ensuring that every code generation, edit, and suggestion is consistent and correct. This system effectively turns Cascade into an expert on <em>your</em> project.</p>

<h5>Rules and Memories: Two Ways to Persist Context</h5>
<p>Windsurf provides two powerful mechanisms for sharing and persisting context with the AI:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p><b>Rules</b>: These are <b>manually defined by you</b>. You explicitly tell Cascade what to do and how to behave. Rules can be set globally for all your projects or locally for a specific workspace. This tutorial will focus primarily on creating and managing Rules.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Memories</b>: These can be <b>automatically generated by Cascade</b>. As you work, the AI can identify useful context or patterns and save it as a memory for future conversations. You can also ask the AI to create a memory manually. While powerful, they are more automated than the explicit instructions provided by rules.</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>What You'll Learn in This Tutorial</h5>
<p>This tutorial is divided into four parts, each building on the last:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Introduction to Windsurf Rules (This Page)</b>: An overview of what rules are, the problems they solve, and what you can expect from this tutorial.</li>
    <li><b>How Rules Work: The Basics</b>: We'll dive into the mechanics of creating global and workspace rules, explore different activation modes, and write a few practical examples to get you started.</li>
    <li><b>Advanced Techniques & Best Practices</b>: Learn how to combine different rules, format them for maximum effectiveness, and understand how manually defined Rules work alongside AI-generated Memories.</li>
    <li><b>Summary and Resources</b>: A final summary of key concepts, tips for effective rule management, and resources for finding pre-made rule templates to use in your projects.</li>
</ol>

<br>
<p>Now that you understand what Windsurf Rules are and how they can enhance your workflow, let's move on to the practical details of how they work.</p>
