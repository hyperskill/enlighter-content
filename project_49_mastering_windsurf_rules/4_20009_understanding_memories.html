<h5>Understanding Memories: The Automated Alternative</h5>

<p>While Rules are your manual instructions, <b>Memories</b> are context that Cascade can generate and store <em>automatically</em>. This is a powerful feature for capturing emerging project details without requiring any action from you.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Automatic Generation</b>: During a conversation, if Cascade encounters information it believes is useful to remember for the future, it can save it as a Memory.</li>
<li><b>Manual Creation</b>: You can also explicitly ask Cascade to create a memory. For example: <em>"create a memory that our API key is stored in the <code>VITE_API_KEY</code> environment variable."</em></li>
<li><b>Workspace-Scoped</b>: Memories are always associated with the workspace they were created in. Cascade will only retrieve them when it believes they are relevant to the current task within that specific workspace.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's test this out by asking Cascade to create a memory for our project.</p>

<callout label="Ask Cascade to create a memory">
Create a memory to write unit tests using Pytest and include both positive and negative test cases.
</callout>

<p>You can view and manage both Rules and Memories at any time by clicking the <b>Customizations icon</b> in the top-right menu.</p>

<p><i>Creating and using auto-generated memories does NOT consume credits.</i></p>

<p>You are now equipped with the knowledge to write and combine rules like a pro. In the next section, we will summarize what we've learned and point you to resources for further exploration.</p>
