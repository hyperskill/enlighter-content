<p>When the app is generated, you can start a conversation with the LLM in your console. Here are some examples for you to try and enjoy:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Type a message like <code>Hello, how are you today?</code> and see how the LLM responds.
</li>
<li>
Try asking a more complex question, such as <code>Can you explain the theory of relativity in simple terms?</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to ask any questions you want. Experiment and enjoy. Keep in mind that processing your queries might take a moment. Be patient.</p>

<p>
To improve UX of the application, you can add a loading indicator with the following command.
</p>
<p>
<callout type="composer">
    Add a progress animation in the terminal while I'm waiting for the LLM response
</callout>
</p>

<p>Now you're a little more familiar with Cursor and console-based applications. You can move on to more complex applications and learn new features. We can help you with that! Bye!</p>
