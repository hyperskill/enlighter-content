<p>You are ready to generate the application.</p>
<p>First, let's check:</p>
<ol interactive>
<li title="You have enabled <code>auto-run</code> mode"></li>
<li title="Your Chat is in <code>agent</code> mode"></li>
</ol>

<p>If yes, it is enough to run this prompt:</p>

<callout type="chat" include-file="project-rules.txt">
Create an app based on requirements @project-rules.txt. Make every piece of functionality testable by running terminal commands. Test the application. Once the application passes all tests, run it.
</callout>

<p>If Chat assystant has terminated but the application has not started, simply enter an additional command in Chat.</p>

<callout type="chat" include-file="project-rules.txt">
Run this application. If an error occurred, try to fix it and then run the application again.</callout>

<alert>
<details>
<summary>What if it doesn't work?</summary>
<div>
<p>If the application doesn't build for a very long time, or it builds but doesn't work as expected, try deleting all project files except project-rules.txt and start generating again.</p>
<p>AI is still not perfect. And a successful result is already very likely, but not mandatory. After several attempts you always get what you need.</p>
<p>We have also noticed that sometimes the application is created but not launched. In this case, you just have to ask Chat: <code>run my application and fix the errors that occurred at startup</code>.</p>
<p>Also, there is a known issue when the Cursor app has expired its attempts to generate your app and it asks to continue manually. You will see this message: <code>"Note: By default, we stop the agent after 25 tool calls. Please ask the agent to resume manually"</code>.</p>
<p>In this case, please open a new Chat and continue fixing the app. Don't forget to check if <code>project-rules.txt</code> is added to make the Chat context work properly.</p>
