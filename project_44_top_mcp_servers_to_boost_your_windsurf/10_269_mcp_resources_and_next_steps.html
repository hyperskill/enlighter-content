<p>Throughout this project, we've explored several powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that extend Windsurf's capabilities. Let's recap what we've learned and explore resources for discovering more MCPs and even building your own.</p>

<h5>What We've Learned</h5>

<p>In this project, we've covered several essential MCPs that enhance Windsurf's functionality:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sequential Thinking MCP: Structured problem-solving with step-by-step reasoning</li>
<li>Context7 MCP: Up-to-date documentation and code examples for libraries</li>
<li>Memory Bank MCP: Structured project context management for AI assistants</li>
<li>GitHub MCP: Direct integration with GitHub repositories and workflows</li>
<li>Knowledge Graph Memory MCP: Persistent memory using a structured knowledge graph</li>
<li>DuckDuckGo MCP: Web search capabilities with content extraction</li>
<li>Compass MCP: Service discovery and recommendation for MCPs</li>
<li>Playwright MCP: Advanced browser automation and testing</li>
</ul><br>

<h5>Finding More MCP Servers</h5>

<p>The ecosystem of MCP servers is constantly growing. Here are several resources to discover more MCP servers for your specific needs:</p>

<h5>Model Context Protocol GitHub Repository</h5>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers">collection of reference implementations for the Model Context Protocol</a>. This is an excellent resource for understanding implementation details, accessing the latest updates, and contributing to the ecosystem.</p>

<h5>MCPServers.org</h5>
<p><a href="https://mcpservers.org">MCPServers.org</a> provides a comprehensive directory of MCP servers organized by category. This resource offers detailed descriptions and installation instructions for a wide range of different servers.</p>

<h5>GitHub Search</h5>
<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/search?q=mcp&type=repositories">GitHub's search functionality</a> to find repositories tagged with "mcp" can help you discover community-created MCP servers and extensions.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
