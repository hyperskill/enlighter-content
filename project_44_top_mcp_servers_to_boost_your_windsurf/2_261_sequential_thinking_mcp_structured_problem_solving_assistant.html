<p>The <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking">Sequential Thinking MCP</a> is a tool that helps break down complex problems into manageable steps, enabling a more structured and reflective approach to problem-solving. This stage will guide you through understanding and implementing this MCP in your Windsurf workflow.</p>

<h5>Features:</h5>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking down complex problems into sequential steps</li>
<li>Revising and refining thoughts as understanding deepens</li>
<li>Creating alternative reasoning paths through branching</li>
<li>Dynamically adjusting the thinking process</li>
<li>Generating and verifying solution hypotheses</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5>Key Use Cases</h5>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Complex system design planning</li>
<li>Project architecture decisions</li>
<li>Code refactoring planning</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5>Setup Instructions</h5>
