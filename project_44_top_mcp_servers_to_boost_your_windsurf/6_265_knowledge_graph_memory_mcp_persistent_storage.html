<p>The <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory">Knowledge Graph Memory MCP</a> is a tool that provides persistent memory capabilities using a local knowledge graph. This powerful server enables Windsurf to remember information about users and projects across chat sessions, creating a more personalized and contextually aware experience. This stage will guide you through setting up and utilizing this MCP in your Windsurf workflow.</p>

<h5>Features:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Store information in a structured knowledge graph</li>
<li>Create and manage entities with unique identifiers and types</li>
<li>Define relationships between entities</li>
<li>Add and manage observations (discrete pieces of information)</li>
<li>Search and retrieve stored knowledge</li>
<li>Maintain context across multiple chat sessions</li>
</ul><br>

<h5>Key Use Cases</h5>
<ul>
<li>Personalized user interactions</li>
<li>Long-term project context maintenance</li>
<li>Storing coding standards and preferences</li>
<li>Building comprehensive knowledge of project requirements</li>
<li>Tracking relationships between project components</li>
</ul><br>

<h5>Setup Instructions</h5>

<alert>âœ… Knowledge Graph Memory MCP is availabe in Windsurf plugin store.</alert>

<p>You can set up the Knowledge Graph Memory MCP using either NPX or Docker. Choose the method that best suits your environment:</p>

<h5>NPX Setup</h5>
<callout type="chat" label="Add the following code to your mcp_config.json file">
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"
      ]
    }
  }
}
</callout>

<h5>Docker Setup</h5>
<callout type="chat" label="Add the following code to your mcp_config.json file">
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", 
        "-i", 
        "-v", 
        "windsurf-memory:/app/dist", 
        "--rm", 
        "mcp/memory"
      ]
    }
  }
}
</callout>

<p>You can also customize the storage location using environment variables:</p>

<callout type="chat" label="Add the following code to your mcp_config.json file">
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_FILE_PATH": "/path/to/custom/memory.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
</callout>

<h5>Practical Example: Knowledge Management</h5>

<callout type="chat">Create a knowledge graph about our project team. Store that John is a frontend developer who knows React and TypeScript. Sarah is a backend developer who works with Node.js. They are both working on the e-commerce project that started in January 2023.</callout>

<p>To test the setup, you can use the following request:</p>

<callout type="chat">What do you know about my team? Check your memory</callout>

<h5>Core Knowledge Graph Concepts</h5>

<p>The Knowledge Graph Memory MCP organizes information using three primary components:</p>

<h5>Entities</h5>
<ul>
<li>Primary nodes in the knowledge graph</li>
<li>Each has a unique name (identifier)</li>
<li>Defined by an entity type (e.g., "person", "organization", "project")</li>
<li>Contains a list of observations (discrete pieces of information)</li>
</ul><h5>Relations</h5>
<ul>
<li>Directed connections between entities</li>
<li>Always stored in active voice</li>
<li>Describe how entities interact or relate to each other</li>
<li>Consist of a source entity, target entity, and relation type</li>
</ul><h5>Observations</h5>
<ul>
<li>Discrete pieces of information about an entity</li>
<li>Stored as strings attached to specific entities</li>
<li>Should be atomic (one fact per observation)</li>
<li>Can be added or removed independently</li>
</ul>
